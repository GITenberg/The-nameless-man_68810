<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> invigorating breeze, stirring the leaves of
the vines and rambler roses which grew in
profusion over the trellis-covered veranda, carried,
apparently, no comfort to the man seated there. He
stared ahead of him, oblivious to his surroundings,
the handsome rugs covering the veranda floor, the
out-of-door furniture, the well-kept lawns and flower
beds. He was only conscious of a growing distaste
for the brilliant California sunshine, the blue of the
heavens and the vivid colors of the foliage; they did
not match his brooding discontent.</p>

<p>A sudden stronger puff of wind carried a paper,
loosely held in his fingers, to the floor, and too indolent
to move, he planted his white-shod foot on
it, leaving exposed the words: “By order of the
Court.”</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are,” exclaimed a voice from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>direction of the living room, and a middle-aged man
stepped through the open French window on to the
veranda and sat down heavily in one of the lounging
chairs. “Seen these?” tossing several newspapers
on the table.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his companion. “Washington
doesn’t appear to have taken kindly to your speech.”</p>

<p>Colonel Calhoun’s florid face turned a deeper
red.</p>

<p>“The truth isn’t always pleasant,” he growled.
“It’s not nice to read that fancied security is fancy
and nothing more. Japan has our measure, and has
spent years preparing to become mistress of the Pacific
Ocean.”</p>

<p>“So they say&mdash;<i>here</i>,” and the slight emphasis on
the last word caused Calhoun’s eyes to flash with
pent-up indignation.</p>

<p>“That’s Washington’s game, trying to make it a
local issue,” he explained heatedly. “Whereas, the
control of the Pacific affects every business man,
every farmer in America. For the sake of our millions
invested in commerce we must guard this ocean;
keep uninterrupted our trade with China and the
Orient; guard the waterway to Alaska, a country of
still undeveloped riches; keep the path clear to the
Philippine Islands, Guam, and Hawaii. Trade supremacy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
can sometimes only be maintained by war.
We shall have to fight for it.”</p>

<p>His companion nodded. “Shouldn’t wonder if
we did,” he agreed listlessly, “when Japan says the
word.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when she strikes she will strike quickly.
Look,” Calhoun indicated a map lying across a chair.
“We have well-fortified harbors, yes, but an <i>undefended</i>
coast line easily accessible to an enemy. Japanese
spies have been caught with reports of these
fortifications, with plans of the forts guarding the
Golden Gate; and caught taking soundings of the
unfortified harbor of Monterey. It means that some
day the ‘Yellow’ man hopes to supplant the white
American, as we, in our time, supplanted the American
red Indian.”</p>

<p>Calhoun’s companion laughed. “It’s not surprising
that the cartoonists caricature you as a saffron-hued
jingoist.”</p>

<p>“Let them,” Calhoun shrugged his broad shoulders.
“They’ll reverse themselves, as did the Administration
in the matter of the Panama Canal tolls,&mdash;the
price of our coastal rights being the sop
thrown to England to keep us out of war with her
ally, Japan.”</p>

<p>“Well, what England did once she may do again,”
retorted the other lazily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“With America prepared we will require no nation’s
intervention in our behalf,” declared Calhoun
proudly. “But until we are&mdash;&mdash;” The speaker
rose and paced back and forth. “Dreaming of vast
empire, the foremost men of Japan are planning
and scheming for that nation’s territorial advancement.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have some difficulty convincing America
of that fact,” said his companion skeptically.</p>

<p>“True.” Calhoun struck his clenched fist into his
left hand. “The majority of Americans think me
a dreamer, or, at worst, a war-mad jingoist. Yesterday
a high government official declared: ‘If Calhoun
had half the brains he thinks he has, he’d be
half-witted.’ The fools!” added Calhoun bitterly.
“It’s cheap to ridicule me, cheaper even than burying
dead Americans in trenches. Japan is crouching
for the spring; racial hatred is fanning the flame,
and her emissaries are everywhere. I’d willingly
give $10,000 to the man who will unearth and expose
the Japanese cabal which, I believe, as I believe
in God, is being conducted in Washington City
today right under the nose of our government officials.”</p>

<p>His companion laid down his unopened cigarette
case, his eyes for a second seeking the paper still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>held on the floor by his foot&mdash;“By order of the
Court”&mdash;a sudden movement and his other foot covered
the words.</p>

<p>“Get out your check book, Calhoun,” he said.
“I will go to Washington.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MAN FROM CALIFORNIA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ulian Barclay</span> scanned the total of a column
of figures with a wry face; his card game
of the night before had been costly, and with an
inward resolve to forego another, he looked out of
the smoking-car window. But the flying landscape
did not hold his attention, and his eyes wandered
back to his fellow passengers, the majority of whom
were well-to-do tourists, several commercial travelers,
and a few professional men. Not far from
him sat Professor Norcross in animated conversation
with Dr. Shively who, with Barclay, had
boarded the fast California express at New Orleans.
Barclay’s glance traveled on until it reached
the man who had made the fourth at the card game.
He had taken a dislike to Dwight Tilghman, for
during the game he had received the impression that
he was being quietly watched. The belief had grown
upon him as the play progressed, and the quiet espionage
had bred resentment. Tilghman’s indolent
slowness of movement had been in direct contrast
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>to his intent watchfulness, and Barclay had wondered
if Dr. Shively and Professor Norcross had
thought Tilghman’s manner peculiar. Richard Norcross,
known to Barclay by his fame as a naturalist
but met for the first time in the train the night
before, had been Tilghman’s traveling companion
for some days.</p>

<p>Barclay, sitting back in his chair studying Tilghman,
saw him start, lean forward, and look down
the car. A newcomer stood just within the entrance
surveying the car and its occupants, then moved
up the aisle. With a smothered ejaculation, Tilghman
sprang into the aisle, hand upraised, only to
stumble forward, swaying like a drunken man.</p>

<p>The sound of the scuffle echoed down the car
above the noise of the rapidly moving train. In an
instant the passengers were on their feet, some intent
on reaching the struggling men and others only
desirous of obtaining a closer view. But the intervention
of the more venturesome was not required,
and a second later Barclay was bending over Tilghman,
who measured his length in the aisle, while the
conductor and several passengers collared his small
opponent. A pull at Barclay’s hastily offered flask,
and Tilghman somewhat shakily regained his feet,
as the Japanese passenger strove to explain the situation
to the indignant conductor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“A meeting, honorable sir, in this just too small
space and a loss of balance.” The Japanese with
some difficulty kept his footing as the train rounded
a sharp curve. Clicking his heels together, with
shoulders and elbows drawn back, finger-tips touching,
he drew a long hissing breath as he bowed in
salutation to the men grouped about him. “Pardon,
honorable sirs.”</p>

<p>“How about it, Mr. Tilghman?” demanded the
conductor, and all eyes turned toward the disheveled
American.</p>

<p>“A little congestion and, eh, hasty action,” he
drawled. “The train took a curve on the high, and
as I fell I saw our friend here”&mdash;indicating the Japanese&mdash;“mistook
him for a yellow nigger standing
in my way and lashed out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barclay looked sharply at the Japanese. Did he
understand the insult implied in the apology, or was
his knowledge of English too limited? But he
learned nothing by his scrutiny, for the parchment-like
face was as inscrutable as the Sphinx, and Barclay
turned his attention to Tilghman. He had distinctly
seen a paper pass between the two men; why
then had Tilghman and the Japanese staged the
opéra bouffe affair?</p>

<p>The conductor, much perturbed, scratched his head
as he gazed at first one man and then another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Well, seeing as how you both call it an accident,
I reckon there’s nothing more to be said,” he grumbled.
“But recollect, gentlemen, this railroad does
not permit quarreling.”</p>

<p>The Japanese, bowing gravely to the silent men,
departed into the forward Pullman, and the group
about Tilghman dispersed. Julian Barclay having
resumed his seat and his contemplation of the scenery
through the car window, was in the act of lighting
a cigarette when he became aware that Dwight
Tilghman was standing at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Can I share that flask you offered me when I
was lying on the floor?” he inquired. “The fall
shook me up more than I realized.”</p>

<p>A look at Tilghman’s white face convinced
Barclay that he was telling the truth, and his interest
quickened; the scuffle had not been entirely
opéra bouffe after all. Drawing out his flask he
passed it to Tilghman.</p>

<p>“It hurts my pride,” went on Tilghman, seating
himself in the next chair, “to be licked by a
little slip of a man in such a rough and tumble encounter.”</p>

<p>“Muscle doesn’t stand much show against jiu-jutsu.”
Barclay declined the other’s offer of a cigarette.
“Better think a second time before tackling
a Jap,” he cautioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“A Jap!” echoed Tilghman, and he smiled queerly
as he selected a cigarette. “The color line is
so closely drawn in this section of the world I’m
surprised the railroad officials permit a yellow man
to travel on the San Francisco, New Orleans, and
Washington Express except in the ‘Jim Crow’
car.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like insular prejudice,” smiled Barclay.
“Except for your name and accent, which
proclaim you a Marylander, I should hail you
as&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A Californian?” Tilghman nodded. “It’s the
state of my adoption. We manage everything better
out there.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not stay in California?” Barclay
rapped out the abrupt question, never taking his
eyes from his good-looking companion, whose white
cheeks were regaining a more healthy hue from the
stimulant he was slowly sipping.</p>

<p>“I had to come east to protest against government
ownership of oil lands in California. I’m
one of the unfortunate devils who invested money
there before the public land was withdrawn from
entry by executive order. Congress is to legislate
on the question shortly. I believe Navy Department
officials are chiefly responsible for the deadlock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“I take it your sympathies are for a little navy?”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t necessarily follow,” protested
Tilghman, with more warmth than the occasion
seemed to justify. “Just because I don’t believe in
government ownership of oil lands.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” argued Barclay. “Oil
is the fuel for future battleships; we are exporting
thousands of gallons of oil; it’s time we conserved
our resources.”</p>

<p>“But not by government ownership,” retorted
Tilghman. “Let the government get oil concessions
in Mexico and <i>keep</i> them. What’s our Monroe
Doctrine for but to make us a protectorate
over most of the western hemisphere? We can
drive out the other Johnnies when they try and
tap our foreign resources.”</p>

<p>“With an adequate navy, yes,” laughed Barclay.
“But you have a curious conception of the meaning
of the Monroe Doctrine.”</p>

<p>“Not at all!” Tilghman warmed to the subject.
“The Monroe Doctrine is just another definition
of ‘dog in the manger’&mdash;we won’t let other nations
have what <i>we</i> won’t take. It’s a shameful waste of
opportunity for territorial advancement.”</p>

<p>“At the expense of smaller nations?” dryly.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, the battle goes to the strong.” Tilghman
turned languidly and beckoned to the porter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>“Is this Atlanta we are approaching?” he asked the
negro.</p>

<p>“Yessir, an’ ’pears like we’ll be hyar mos’ two
hours, ’cause there’s a washout ahead. De conductor
says as how de passengers can go off an’ see
de city, but dey mus’ be back hyar widdin an hour
an’ a half.”</p>

<p>Barclay rose and stretched himself. “Think I’ll
go and take a run around the block,” he announced,
smothering a yawn. “Come along?”</p>

<p>But Tilghman shook his head, and watched Barclay’s
tall, erect figure pass down the aisle with a
touch of envy. The other men in the smoker, pausing
to exchange a word with him, filed out of the
car, and Tilghman, left to his own resources, placed
his tickets in the band of his hat, pulled the brim
over his face; lowered the window shade, braced
his legs on a convenient ledge, poured out a liberal
portion of raw spirits in the silver cup of Barclay’s
flask, and holding the cup in his hand, settled back
in his chair and, closing his eyes, sipped the brandy
at intervals.</p>

<p>Julian Barclay, whistling cheerily, was making
his way out of the station at Atlanta when the crowd
ahead of him parted, and he caught a glimpse of a
familiar face. Wheeling about with an abruptness
that brought him into violent collision with the Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
whose behavior in the train had so excited
his interest, Barclay, never glancing at him, raced
back to the train.</p>

<p>Two hours later Barclay stood in the vestibule of
his Pullman as the train pulled out on its long trip
northward, and debated whether to enter the
smoker or return to his section. The stronger inclination
won and, nodding in a friendly fashion
to the Japanese who stood on the opposite side of
the vestibule, Barclay entered the car on his way
to the smoker.</p>

<p>Except for Dwight Tilghman sitting at the further
end, Barclay found the smoker deserted, and
dropped into the nearest chair, lighted a cigar,
opened a newspaper and soon became immersed
in its contents. Some time later the conductor
paused before Tilghman, removed the tickets from
his hatband and, refraining from waking him,
passed on up the car collecting fares.</p>

<p>The shadows of the winter day were lengthening
when the dining car steward’s announcement:
“First call for dinner,” aroused the half dozen men
in the smoker.</p>

<p>Professor Norcross, who had been chatting with
Julian Barclay, broke off to ask: “Where’s my
dinner partner? Here, porter, go tell Mr. Tilghman
it’s time for dinner. Won’t you sit at our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>table tonight?” he added, addressing Barclay. “Dr.
Shively will make the fourth.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’ll be very glad to do so,” and Barclay
rose with alacrity; he had not lunched at Atlanta,
and his appetite was sharpened by the fast. Further
speech was cut short by a shout from the porter.</p>

<p>“I can’t wake Mister Tilghman,” he called, his
eyes rolling in fright. “He musta had a stroke.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Dr. Shively dropped the book he
was reading, and hastened down the aisle. But his
air of skepticism disappeared as he bent over Tilghman
who, owing to the vigorous shaking administered
by the porter, was sprawling half out of his
chair. The physician lifted the hat which had
slipped over Tilghman’s face, and pulled down an
eyelid. One glance at the glazing eyeball, a touch
of the pulse, and Shively faced toward Julian Barclay
and Professor Norcross who had followed him
down the aisle.</p>

<p>“Dead,” he announced. “Stone dead.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">WAYS THAT ARE DARK</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>n</span> awed silence followed Dr. Shively’s announcement.</p>

<p>Barclay was the first to speak. “Apoplexy?” he
inquired, looking pityingly down at the still figure.
His question received no reply.</p>

<p>“Porter, go call the conductor,” directed Shively.
“No, stay, first show me into a vacant stateroom.
Norcross, will you and Barclay carry Tilghman;
I can make a more careful and complete examination
in the privacy of a stateroom.”</p>

<p>The other occupants of the smoker had left immediately
on the first call for dinner, and the porter
leading the way, Professor Norcross and Barclay
carried their burden into the forward stateroom
of the car behind, encountering no one on
their way to it. Shively stopped for a moment to
glance keenly about the empty smoker, then followed
the little procession into the stateroom.</p>

<p>“Suppose you return to the smoker, Barclay,”
suggested Shively, bending over Tilghman and loosening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
his tie. “And&mdash;eh&mdash;just as a matter of form,
see that nothing is disturbed in there. The porter
is too rattled to be left in charge. And, Norcross,
please step into my Pullman and get my grip. Don’t
either of you mention Tilghman’s death just yet to
the other passengers.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” promised the professor, and Barclay,
contenting himself with a nod of agreement,
went back to the smoker. Reaching the empty car
he paced rapidly up and down the aisle, a feeling
of horror growing upon him. The frail barrier
between the quick and the dead had lifted momentarily&mdash;Tilghman,
within arm’s reach of assistance,
had died in their midst without a hand being raised
to save him.</p>

<p>An involuntary shiver crept down Barclay’s spine,
and he moistened his dry lips; he felt the need of
stimulants. Remembering that he had loaned his
flask to Tilghman, he moved reluctantly over to the
chair the dead man had occupied and hunted about.
The flask was not in sight. As he straightened up
from investigating the corners of Tilghman’s chair,
he saw Professor Norcross regarding him from the
doorway, and glad to be no longer alone in the
gloomy car, he joined him.</p>

<p>“Discovered what ailed Tilghman, Professor?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Not yet.” Norcross selected a chair in the middle
of the car and Barclay balanced himself on the
arm of one across the aisle. “Poor Tilghman! He
so counted on enjoying this trip to Washington. It
was his first visit east in nearly ten years.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Had you known him long?”</p>

<p>“We met several years ago at Colonel Carter
Calhoun’s residence during one of my trips to California.”
The car tilted at an uncomfortable angle
as the train raced around a curve, and Barclay almost
slid into the professor’s lap. “Tilghman at
one time was quite wealthy,” went on Norcross,
reaching out a steadying hand. “Then he invested
heavily in oil concessions both in this country and
in Mexico; I imagine Calhoun had a good deal to
do with putting him on his feet again.”</p>

<p>“Was he married?”</p>

<p>“I believe not. He told me that he expected to
visit Dr. Leonard McLane in Washington, and said
the latter was his nearest living relative. I shall
wire McLane from the next station. Ah, here’s
the conductor,” as that uniformed official, looking
much perturbed, came in. “Did you see Dr.
Shively?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Professor.” The conductor mopped his
face with a large handkerchief. “Mr. Tilghman’s
sudden taking off has been a shock. Why didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>he mention that he was ill when I took his ticket?”</p>

<p>“Heaven knows!” Norcross shook his head pityingly.
“We were all within call. Did he appear
ill, Conductor?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get a good look at his face, for his hat
was pulled down low over his forehead. Judging
from his attitude that he was asleep, I took pains
not to disturb him, as he had told me only this morning
that he hadn’t slept well on this trip, owing to
a bad tooth.”</p>

<p>“Aside from toothache, I never heard Tilghman
complain of feeling badly,” said Norcross. “He
looked the picture of health, strong&mdash;wiry&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His scuffle this noon with the Japanese may have
been more serious than we imagined,” suggested
Barclay slowly. “The Jap resorted to jiu-jutsu, and
it’s a nasty thing to run up against.”</p>

<p>“True,” agreed Norcross. “I’ve seen something
of that science in the East, and have heard of men
sometimes dying from apoplexy after a blow.”</p>

<p>“But that did not follow in this instance,” broke
in Dr. Shively, joining them. “I am glad to have
found you all together. Conductor, here is the key
of the stateroom; I have locked Tilghman’s body
in there, and have stationed the porter outside this
car with instructions to let no one in until you give
him permission.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Seems to me that’s pretty extreme,” exclaimed
the conductor.</p>

<p>“I did it because I must have a word with you in
private, and this car must be thoroughly searched
before other passengers are admitted.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded the conductor. The physician’s
grave manner impressed them all and they
gathered nearer in silence.</p>

<p>“Tilghman was murdered.”</p>

<p>“What?” chorused the men.</p>

<p>“Good God! Who did it?” demanded Barclay,
recovering somewhat from his astonishment, while
Professor Norcross asked:</p>

<p>“How was the crime committed?”</p>

<p>“One at a time.” Shively held up a protesting
hand. “It is for us to discover who is the murderer.”</p>

<p>“Was he stabbed, sir?” asked the conductor.</p>

<p>“No; nor shot.” The physician seated himself
and checked his remarks off on his fingers. “On
superficial examination here, I concluded that Tilghman
had died from cardiac syncope; he had apparently
every symptom. But it happened that last
night he came to me and asked for some cocaine
to deaden the pain in his tooth. Before treating
him with the cocaine, I tested his heart and found
he had no valvular weakness. Therefore I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>astounded as well as horrified by his sudden death,
and determined to make an examination.”</p>

<p>“An autopsy?” gasped the conductor.</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” Shively leaned forward and spoke
louder, to make sure that he was heard above the
rattle of the train. “I could find no mark on Tilghman’s
body; he had most certainly not been either
stabbed or shot. And then, although all indications
were against my theory, I thought of poison.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a stomach pump with you?” asked
Norcross, who was listening with absorbed attention.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, no. But on examining Tilghman’s
mouth I detected the odor of alcohol, and
removing the absorbent cotton from the cavity in
his lower back tooth, I submitted it to chemical tests
and found traces of a solution of oxalic acid and
brandy.”</p>

<p>Barclay turned cold. Brandy containing poison?
Where in the world was his flask? What had become
of it? His thoughts running riot, he listened
dazedly to the conductor’s excited questions.</p>

<p>“What’s oxalic acid?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“A vegetable poison, better known under the
name of ‘salts of lemon’; a powder which, if dissolved
in alcohol, kills almost instantly,” was the
reply. “Also, the symptoms it produces are identical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
with heart failure, the acid producing manifestation
of great weakness, small pulse, and failure
of the heart’s power.”</p>

<p>“So Tilghman simply faded away before our
eyes,” exclaimed Norcross sorrowfully. “Oh, the
pity of it!”</p>

<p>“He didn’t die before our eyes,” retorted Shively
tartly. “By the condition of the body I judge
Tilghman had been dead about six hours.”</p>

<p>His listeners stared at him, astounded.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say Mr. Tilghman sat in that
chair with us all about him, stone dead, and we
never discovered it for six hours?” questioned the
conductor in open incredulity.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, that beats time!” muttered the conductor.</p>

<p>“Where were we six hours ago?” asked Norcross.</p>

<p>The conductor consulted his watch. “In Atlanta,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“I imagine that was where the crime was committed,”
said Shively. “Who was in this car beside
Tilghman during the two hours we were in
that station?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned the conductor. “But I
can easily find out by asking the porter,” and he
hastened out of the smoker, to reappear a second
later with the porter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“No, suh, there wasn’t no one in this here smoker
while we was in Atlanta ’cept Mr. Tilghman,” declared
the negro, on being questioned. “Not a soul,
I’ll take my Bible oath to that. I looked in here a
few minutes after de train stopped an’ Mr. Tilghman
was a settin’ in de chair jus’ as ca’m an’ peaceful,
an’ I went outside an’ stood on de platform by
de steps at dat end, an’ didn’t no one pass into de
car while we was in de station.”</p>

<p>“How about this end of the car?” questioned the
conductor. “The vestibule&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Norcross and I sat there and smoked the whole
time we were in Atlanta, except for the first twenty
minutes when we got some lunch at the station restaurant,”
broke in Shively sharply. “No one entered
the car while we were there. If the crime
was committed it was done during the first twenty
minutes the train was in the station.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Tilghman order any brandy, porter?”
asked Norcross.</p>

<p>“No, suh, he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Might it not be that Tilghman, in a moment
of despondency, killed himself?” asked Norcross,
turning to the physician. “He carried a brandy
flask in his bag.”</p>

<p>“If a death is possibly suicidal, it is also possibly
homicidal,” explained Shively. “The brandy flask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>is still in Tilghman’s bag, full to the brim and entirely
free from oxalic acid.”</p>

<p>“He might have borrowed a flask from some
one,” suggested Barclay slowly. “And added the
poison himself.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, he might have. But if it’s a case of
suicide, where is the flask?” asked Shively. “Tilghman
didn’t swallow that also.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hunt for it,” and the conductor started
forward.</p>

<p>“Did you look about the car when you first entered,
Barclay?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Barclay passed his hand over the upholstered
back of a chair. “But I didn’t find anything
remotely resembling a flask.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” muttered Shively. “I found no flask
in his pockets, and he certainly did not move out
of that chair after swallowing the poison. Porter,
were any of these windows opened?”</p>

<p>“Yessuh, an’ dey is still open wid de screens in jes’
as I lef dem.”</p>

<p>“True. Well, he couldn’t have flung a flask
through a window glass or a screen without doing
considerable damage, of which there is no indication;
besides which, the action of the poison is very
swift, he would not have had the strength to make
any such attempt.” Dropping on his knees Shively,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>with the aid of a powerful magnifying glass, examined
the carpet beneath Tilghman’s chair and
the chair itself. “There is no stain, showing Tilghman
did not drop the cup out of which he was
drinking. No, no, someone else was in this car, administered
the poison, and carried off the incriminating
glass or flask.”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been that little Jap, Mr. Ito,”
ejaculated the conductor. “He’s got the creepiest
ways, and there was bad blood between him and
Mr. Tilghman, witness their fight this noon.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you bring Mr. Ito here,” suggested
Norcross, then addressing Shively. “It will do no
harm to question him.”</p>

<p>The physician nodded, and drawing out his notebook
made several entries; neither he nor Norcross
paid attention to Julian Barclay, who was striding
nervously up and down the aisle. Should he speak
of having loaned his flask to Tilghman? Would
they believe him entirely innocent if they knew&mdash; The
entrance of the Japanese and the conductor
broke in on his troubled cogitations.</p>

<p>The Japanese stopped before Dr. Shively, bowed
profoundly, and waited in impressive silence for
him to speak.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ito,” began Shively, with a courteous acknowledgment
of the other’s salutation. “I sent for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>you to inform you that Mr. Tilghman is dead.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mr. Tilghman?” inquired Ito.</p>

<p>“The man you fought here this morning.”</p>

<p>“I no fought man,” denied Ito politely. “Stranger
fell upon me and I struggled to stand&mdash;that all.
Mr. Tilghman, you say his name, he no well when
he stagger and fall on me, and now he dead?”</p>

<p>“And now he is dead,” repeated Shively, raising
his voice so as to be heard above the rumble of the
train. “Dead, from drinking a poisonous compound
derived from rice.”</p>

<p>“So?” Ito reflected. “It what you call ‘hard
luck.’”</p>

<p>Shively’s color rose. “It is ‘hard luck’ which I
call upon you to explain,” he said stiffly. “Kindly
inform me where you spent your time during the
two hours this train was in Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“Why you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because during that time or, to be more exact,
six hours ago, Mr. Tilghman was poisoned by
drinking brandy containing a solution of oxalic acid.
Where were you at that time, Mr. Ito?”</p>

<p>“You say he died six hours ago?” The Japanese
consulted his watch and did some rapid calculating.
“That make time he swallow poison five
minutes past twelve. At that hour I was in public
ribrary in Atlanta. I talk with ribrarian and take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>out book card&mdash;he stamp time on it. If you no believe,
wire ribrarian at my expense and see I tell
truth.”</p>

<p>Shively looked at Norcross and Barclay and then
back at Ito.</p>

<p>“The seriousness of the situation obliges me to get
corroboration of your statement, Mr. Ito,” he said.
“I shall wire at the first opportunity to the Atlanta
library.”</p>

<p>“Then now’s your chance,” broke in the conductor.
“We are just stopping at Greenville.”</p>

<p>“Can you hold the train for an answer?” asked
Shively.</p>

<p>“No, we are late already and must make up time,”
called the conductor, as he made for the door.
“Wire the librarian to send his answer to meet the
train at Spartanburg, our next stop.”</p>

<p>Shively made ready to follow the conductor.
“Keep your eye on Ito,” he muttered to Barclay in
passing, then louder: “Come with me, Norcross.
I want you to telegraph to Spartanburg for a stomach
pump, while I get a wire off to the librarian.”</p>

<p>A second more and Barclay and the Japanese had
the smoker to themselves. Barclay did not relish
being stared out of countenance by a bit of yellow
parchment, but he never permitted his glance to waver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
before the steady regard of the oblique black
eyes. Ito was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Will the honorable sir permit that I dine?” he
asked.</p>

<p>At the request Barclay awoke to the realization
that he was half famished. Tilghman’s tragic death
had put all thought of dinner out of his mind. Obviously
he must not let the Japanese out of his sight,
and there was surely no better place than a dining
car for keeping him in full view.</p>

<p>“Of course you can dine,” he said cheerily. “We
both will; go ahead, Mr. Ito, and I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>They made their way through the long train and
on reaching the dining car were given a table for
two. After giving his order to their waiter, Barclay
settled back in his chair with a sigh of relief;
the change from the gloomy smoker and its tragic
happenings, to the cheery dining car, flooded with
light and echoing with the laughter and chatter of
gay passengers, was a tonic in itself to his frayed
nerves.</p>

<p>Not waiting for the return of their waiter, Barclay
lifted the carafe and leaning over poured some
water into Ito’s glass. The courtesy received no
acknowledgment, for the Japanese was intent on
drawing a design on the spotless tablecloth. Barclay
watched each stroke of the pencil in idle curiosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
but suddenly the carafe remained poised in
air, for with the skill of a born artist, there grew
under the Japanese’s hand an exquisite design of
the chrysanthemum&mdash;the identical design which,
done in delicate tracery, made Julian Barclay’s silver
brandy flask unique.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ALIBI</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“Y</span>ou</span> deny, then, having seen that chrysanthemum
design on my silver flask?” persisted Barclay,
his anger rising at Ito’s evasive replies to his repeated
question.</p>

<p>The Japanese thoughtfully contemplated the soup
tureen which the waiter placed impartially midway
between the two men.</p>

<p>“I am originator of designs, honorable sir,” he
said blandly. “It is possibly so that my sketch was
used in decorating your flask. Show me flask and
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve&mdash;I’ve lost my flask,” stammered Barclay.
If the Japanese really had been at the Atlanta library
at the hour Tilghman was poisoned he would
know nothing of the flask, and he might be one of
the Japanese employed by large silversmiths in this
country to furnish them designs. But if he had
been present at Tilghman’s murder and had guilty
knowledge&mdash;Barclay’s stubborn chin became more
pronounced; his future actions, however, hinged on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>the little man’s alibi. “Mr. Ito,” he began deliberately,
“you state that you are an artistic designer
traveling in America to get in personal touch with
your customers. But your name is not one usually
associated with trade in your own country.”</p>

<p>Ito sipped his black coffee meditatively. “I poor
Nipponese,” he announced. “You rich American.
I travel in your country to make money; you traveled
in my country,” Ito paused to pepper his soup,
“and bought curios.”</p>

<p>The quick retort on Barclay’s lips remained unspoken
as Shively stopped at their table.</p>

<p>“The engineer is making up time,” he said, clinging
to the table as the train went around a mountain
curve and unbalanced him for the moment. “We’ll
be in Spartanburg very soon. Norcross and I are
sitting here,” and he joined the professor at the table
directly across from them.</p>

<p>Barclay passed a relish to the Japanese in silence,
and still without speaking they continued their
dinner, each apparently immersed in his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>If Ito observed that he was watched by Shively
and Norcross as well as Barclay, there was no effort
on his part to hasten the service of the meal, and
he waited with patient courtesy for Barclay to finish
before rising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“My car next,” he volunteered, taking his hat
from the waiter.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, I’ll come with you.” Barclay pushed
back his chair impatiently and his long stride
quickly brought him up with his companion, but not
in time to exchange a word in private, for Shively
was at their side with Professor Norcross in tow.</p>

<p>“Are these your traps, Mr. Ito?” Shively pointed
to two suitcases, an overcoat, and an umbrella
propped up in one of the sections of the sleeper.</p>

<p>“Yes, honorable doctor.” Ito gravely picked up
his overcoat and umbrella. “We approach Spartanburg&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We do,” dryly. “Just drawing into the station
in fact, and here’s the conductor. Don’t move, Mr.
Ito,” and Shively’s deep voice spoke command.
“Wait.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your telegram, Doctor, the station master
threw it to me.” The conductor was a trifle breathless.
“What does it say, sir?”</p>

<p>Snatching it from him Shively tore open the dispatch
and scanned it hurriedly. A look of perplexity
replaced his eagerness as he read the message
aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yoshida Ito was in library from noon until twenty minutes
of two <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> today. Had long talk with him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">C. L. Glenworth</span>, librarian.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The Japanese, standing hat in hand, overcoat
over arm, spoke first.</p>

<p>“Is it permitted that I go?” he asked, addressing
all but looking at Shively.</p>

<p>“Surely.” The conductor stepped aside and Ito,
bowing gravely, motioned to the waiting porter to
take his suitcases, and started for the vestibule of
the sleeper.</p>

<p>“One moment,” protested Shively, and Ito
stopped, but again the conductor interfered.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Mr. Ito,” he directed, and added, as
Shively opened his mouth to expostulate, “No, no,
Doctor, you can’t hold Mr. Ito, for you haven’t
proved one thing against him; the librarian confirms
his alibi.”</p>

<p>“But why should he leave the train at once, unless
he’s running away?” demanded Norcross.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ito was only traveling as far as this anyway,”
explained the conductor hurriedly. “His
ticket read from Mobile to Spartanburg.”</p>

<p>On impulse Barclay wheeled about and made for
the vestibule of the sleeper, but on reaching the platform
he found he was too late&mdash;Yoshida Ito had
vanished. Barclay returned to the smoker in time
to hear the conductor’s concluding remark to Dr.
Shively.</p>

<p>“Very well, Doctor,” he was saying. “Seeing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>that this Dr. Leonard McLane, whom Mr. Tilghman
was on his way to visit, is his nearest relative,
I’ll carry the body to Washington, but there the
undertaker will have to ship it back to Atlanta for
the coroner’s inquest, provided, of course, that Mr.
Tilghman was really poisoned, as the crime must
have been committed in the Atlanta jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” acknowledged Shively. “The porter
has just brought me the stomach pump I telegraphed for,
and in your presence, Conductor, and
that of Professor Norcross and Mr. Barclay, I will
make a further and fuller test for trace of poison.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable.” The worried railroad
employee looked somewhat relieved. “I’ll join
you in the stateroom as soon as the train leaves here.
Let me give you the key to the stateroom,” and he
dropped it into the physician’s hand.</p>

<p>With a strong feeling of reluctance Barclay accompanied
Shively and Norcross into the stateroom.
Shively had done what he could with the means at
his command to convert the stateroom into an operating
office; his bag, bottles, instruments&mdash;the latter
lying in neat array on one of the couches on
which was spread a white sheet. A sheet also was
thrown over Tilghman’s body, lying on the other
couch. The scene brought vividly to Barclay’s mind
the clinics he had attended years before, and as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>sniffed the pungent odor of disinfectants, he almost
imagined himself back once more obeying the directions
of a famous surgeon. Shively’s voice recalled
him to his surroundings.</p>

<p>“I examined Tilghman’s pockets hoping to find
some clew of the murderer,” explained Shively.
“And took pains to replace each article as I found
it, as Norcross can testify.” The professor confirmed
his statement with a vigorous nod.</p>

<p>“Did you discover anything which might turn into
a clew?” inquired Barclay eagerly.</p>

<p>“Nothing that I considered a clew, but the police
may have better luck.” Shively paused to tear open
the package he carried, and fitting the instrument
together, laid it with others on the couch. “A letter
from Dr. McLane, a bunch of keys, a bill folder
containing several hundred dollars, some loose
change, and that is all.”</p>

<p>“A meager list for identification purposes,” commented
Barclay.</p>

<p>“If I could only lay my hands on the flask, or
glass, from which Tilghman drank the brandy,”
fumed Shively. “Then I’d have the murderer.”
The opening of the door interrupted him. “Ah,
Conductor, come in and close the door; now, if you
are ready we can commence.”</p>

<p>Several times while the stomach pump was in use
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>Barclay became conscious of Shively’s scrutiny, and
he mentally cursed the instinct which betrayed his
familiarity with medical instruments. Suddenly
Shively held up a test tube, and his expression told
the conductor what his lack of medical knowledge
prevented him from grasping sooner.</p>

<p>“So Mr. Tilghman was poisoned,” he stated,
rather than asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and by a dose of oxalic acid calculated to
kill a dozen men,” said Shively gravely. “Who
could have administered it?”</p>

<p>“Who, indeed?” Barclay spoke with more force
than he realized, and colored as they turned toward
him. “I’m going to make it my business to find out,
Dr. Shively. Good night,” and not waiting for a
reply he stepped into the corridor and made his way
swiftly back to his own Pullman.</p>

<p>Barclay had been fortunate enough to secure an
entire section to himself, owing to the scarcity of
passengers, for the rush had set in to the south, and
few were traveling northward. He found his berth
not yet made up, and sinking back in his seat he
thought over the events of the day. A painful desire
to sneeze sent his fingers searching his pockets
for a handkerchief, and in drawing it out a small
object fell in his lap. After replacing his handkerchief
Barclay picked up the chamois-covered bundle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>and unwound it. A girl’s face smiled up at him
from the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>Barclay looked and looked again at the miniature,
unable to believe his eyes. How had a painting of
a total stranger gotten into one of his pockets? He
turned over the miniature hoping to find some name
or initial engraved on its back, but the handsome
gold case was as blank as Barclay’s mind. Gradually
his dazed wits grasped the beauty of the girl.
The artist had done full justice to the exquisite coloring
and contour of the face, the golden curly hair,
and the deep blue eyes, eyes so direct and clear they
held his gaze, and he was conscious of a tantalizing
wish to see her lips break into the smile which hovered
in her eyes.</p>

<p>Barclay attempted to open the case, but there was
no sign of hinge or spring, and fearing to break the
ivory miniature in attempting to force it open, he rewrapped
the gold case in the chamois and replaced it
in his pocket. Could it be that someone on the
train had dropped the miniature and he had absent-mindedly
pocketed it? He racked his brain trying
to recall each action of the day, but the miniature
bore apparently no relation to any of them. How
had it been slipped inside his pocket unknown to
him? The thing smelt of legerdemain, and instantly
his thoughts flew to the Japanese&mdash;but that was impossible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
The girl was an American and her refinement
and high bred air instantly placed her social
position; she would not be likely to permit her miniature
to be carried about by a Japanese designer, an
artist&mdash;Good Lord!</p>

<p>Barclay stared in blank dismay at the seat before
him, and gradually awoke to the realization that he
was gazing directly at Professor Norcross, who had
seated himself there a second or two before. With
an effort Barclay pulled himself together.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you haven’t turned in,” said the professor.
“For my own part I can’t sleep. Listen, Barclay,”
he moved over and sat down by the latter.
“I have made the most astounding discovery&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Barclay, as the professor
paused to permit a passenger promenading the aisle
to pass out of hearing.</p>

<p>“We have let a murderer slip through our fingers,”
groaned the professor.</p>

<p>“Then you have identified&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Ito?” breaking in on Barclay’s question. “Yes.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Listen!” Norcross spoke slowly and emphasized
each point. “Ito was the only person on the train
who had a motive for the crime. Tilghman insulted
him grossly; nothing so infuriates a Japanese as to
be classed with a negro; they are the proudest race
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>in the world. Ito took prompt retaliation on Tilghman
for&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how, Professor?” Barclay interrupted in his
turn. “It has been proved by the librarian that Ito
was at the Atlanta library at noon today, and Tilghman
was poisoned at that same hour in the smoking
car of this train.”</p>

<p>“Tilghman was killed here at noon, but not at
the identical <i>hour</i>. Ito was at the library&mdash;man,
you forget that Atlanta goes by central time, which
is one hour slower than the eastern time, which prevails
on this train&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you mean&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“That calculating by our watches Ito poisoned
Tilghman at noon and an hour <i>later</i>, which by
our time would be one o’clock, and by Atlanta
time would be noon, was in the library. Thus he
had ample opportunity to commit the crime and
establish a perfectly good alibi at the Atlanta
library.”</p>

<p>“But the Atlanta librarian telegraphed he was
there at noon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course, he was going by central time which,
as I have just mentioned, prevails in Atlanta. We
have been going by our watches which are one hour
<i>ahead</i> of Atlanta. And between us we have muddled
things up finely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Let me get this clear!” Barclay rumpled his hair
with both hands. “Going by Atlanta time, Ito
poisoned Tilghman at eleven o’clock this morning,
and was at the library at twelve?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“But by the time prevailing on this train and our
watches, Ito poisoned Tilghman at twelve o’clock
and was at the library at one&mdash;and relying on our
forgetting in our excitement the difference of time,
handed us a perfectly good alibi.”</p>

<p>“You’ve put it in a nutshell.” Norcross rose.
“The only opportunity the murderer had of entering
the smoker unobserved was during the first
twenty minutes following the train’s arrival in Atlanta.
After that Shively and I stood in the
vestibule smoking, while the porter was standing
at the other end of the car until the train pulled out
of the station.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to think of the difference
in time?” asked Barclay detaining the professor.</p>

<p>“Shively observed the hour stamped on the Atlanta
telegram and commented on the fact that it
was sent before he had wired, then we looked up the
question of time, and that gave us the clew. To
think of Ito putting it over on us.” The professor
clenched his fists. “I’d like to put my hands on
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“So would I,” agreed Barclay cordially. “I have
quite a number of questions to ask him,” and a
mental vision of the girl of the miniature obscured
for the moment the kindly, clever face of the
naturalist.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“P</span>lease</span> tell Mrs. Ogden, Rose, that I will join
her at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Ogden,” and the trim maid
departed.</p>

<p>Ethel Ogden, conscious that she had made a hurried
toilet, and feeling but half awake, paused before
her cheval glass and took a final look at her costume
and hair, patting a stray curl into place, then left
her bedroom in search of her cousin. She had a
dim impression that to be late for breakfast would
rank with one of the crimes of the Decalogue in the
eyes of Walter Ogden.</p>

<p>The climate in Washington that winter had
proved too severe for Ethel’s father, and by the
advice of his physician he had gone in December to
winter with friends in Atlanta. Mrs. Ogden, torn
between anxiety for her husband and her desire to
be with Ethel, had thankfully accepted their cousins’
invitation to have Ethel spend the winter with them.</p>

<p>Walter Ogden had been a frequent visitor to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>National Capital for a dozen years or more, and in
times gone by, before he had made his not inconsiderable
fortune, Commodore Ogden had assisted him
financially on several occasions. Both Walter
Ogden and his wife had urged Ethel to visit them in
their western home, but she had never been able to
accept. Their last invitation had solved many difficulties
for it enabled her to remain in Washington
and continue her work.</p>

<p>Commodore Ogden, who had retired before the
age limit from the United States Navy on account
of old wounds, had found, some years before, his
modest savings swept away in unfortunate speculation,
and outstanding debts had further crippled his
resources. Ethel, to the horror of her mother,
whose old-fashioned ideas did not include a tolerant
view of the modern woman, had found her <i>metier</i>
in teaching English to foreigners residing in Washington,
and with the salary received from her pupils
dressed herself and contributed to the household
expenses.</p>

<p>During the forty-eight hours she had been with
her cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ogden, she had
seen little of them, owing to her own business and
social engagements, and had not had time to
properly adjust herself to the household routine.
The house was a large one, and reaching an intersecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
corridor in the wide wall, Ethel paused in
indecision. Had she turned to her right or to her
left when leaving Mrs. Ogden’s pretty bedroom the
night before? Debating the point in her own mind,
however, did not settle the question, and Ethel, finding
a bedroom door ajar on her right, laid her hand
on the knob.</p>

<p>“Caught entering ‘Blue Beard’s chamber,’” said
a soft languid voice just back of her, and wheeling
about Ethel confronted her cousin. “Fie! Fie!
Ethel.”</p>

<p>“I plead guilty only to searching for you.” Ethel’s
gay laugh was infectious. “Tell me, is ‘Blue Beard’s
chamber’ where Cousin Walter abides?”</p>

<p>“Mercy, no.” Mrs. Ogden tucked her hand inside
Ethel’s. “‘Blue Beard’s Chamber’ is the <i>raison
d’être</i> of our being here. On account of it
Walter was offered the house at a ridiculously low
rental&mdash;one hundred and fifty dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty for this!” Ethel’s voice
was raised in a crescendo of astonishment, and her
eyes swept the well proportioned hallway and the
vista of spacious rooms opening from it, and the
handsome stairway down which they were passing.
“Is there a ‘harnt,’ as the darkies say, in ‘Blue
Beard’s Chamber,’ or is the house considered unlucky
that the owners give it away?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Neither&mdash;a much less romantic reason. The
owner, what is his name? Never mind, Walter attends
to all that”&mdash;with placid disregard of details.
“The owner is a <i>divorcé</i> who, owing to some technicality
of the decree, must keep his legal residence
in Washington; so he leases this house for a song,
with the proviso that he is permitted to keep a bedroom
containing his personal belongings and occupy
it occasionally.”</p>

<p>“But, Cousin Jane, how unpleasant!” ejaculated
Ethel. “Suppose he elects to spend the winter with
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, at that, my dear, we’d be saving money.”
Mrs. Ogden straightened a rug on the handsome
hardwood floor. “It’s a wonderful house for the
money, and you know nothing pleases Walter so
much as to save.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden’s frank discussion of family traits
and failings was apt to prove disconcerting and
Ethel colored with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I think it is perfectly dear of you to take me
in this winter,” she began, but Mrs. Ogden cut her
short.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at it in that light, my dear,” she said
with kindly intent. “Both Walter and I are devoted
to you, and I am looking forward to your companionship
this winter. Walter is so immersed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>business, and he never will assist me in my social
duties.”</p>

<p>“Late again, Jane,” announced a querulous voice
as they entered the dining room, and Walter Ogden
looked up from behind the folds of a morning paper.
“I hope, Ethel, you will teach Jane punctuality.”</p>

<p>“I’m more apt to prove a culprit in that regard
than a teacher,” declared Ethel. “I’m seldom on
time in the early morning.”</p>

<p>“Too many late hours,” grumbled Ogden, rising
heavily to pull out a chair for his wife.</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy the dance last night, Ethel?”
asked Mrs. Ogden, rattling the coffee cups with unnecessary
vigor in the hope of diverting Ethel’s
attention from Ogden’s early breakfast grumpiness.</p>

<p>“Very much!” Ethel took a large helping of cereal
offered her by the attentive butler. “But it was a
later affair than I anticipated, and on the way home
Jim Patterson’s car had a blow-out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did Mr. Patterson bring you back?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the Marshalls as well.” Ethel smiled
demurely. Mrs. Ogden’s interest in James Patterson,
United States representative from California,
was transparent.</p>

<p>“I can’t think why you don’t marry Jim Patterson,
Ethel; he’s asked you often enough,” remarked
Mrs. Ogden, taking in her cousin’s fresh young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>beauty with an appraising glance. “And then you
would be able to give up your tiresome teaching.”</p>

<p>“But my teaching is not tiresome,” protested
Ethel, flushing hotly. “You try giving lessons in
conversational English to some of the diplomats and
you will soon find how amusing it is.”</p>

<p>“I hope for the foreigner’s sake, Ethel, you don’t
use old-fashioned phrase books,” broke in Ogden.
“I recall that some years ago the wife of a diplomat
brushed up her English, of which she spoke only
a few words, before attending a large luncheon, and
during a pause in the conversation, she remarked
politely to her hostess: ‘I see the rat. The rat is
under the chair,’ and consternation prevailed until
the hostess and other guests grasped the situation.”</p>

<p>“My pupils have no opportunity to quote from
primers,” laughed Ethel. “I never use them. We
talk, read, and compose, and I have them write letters
to me. Oh!” she paused and took a letter from
her bag. “This came last night from Maru Takasaki.
I asked him to write me his impressions of
the Diplomatic Reception at the White House. Do
listen, he is my prize pupil,” and she read the note
aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My dear Miss Ogden</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I have honor to inform you a news which you have been
so anxious to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Last evening we went duly to the White House where we
were received by Mr. President, assisted by the ladies of the
Cabinet as usual.</p>

<p>All the rooms were lighted brilliantly, and the Marine
musical band made the scenery more vivid and attractive.
The strange costumes of the different countries, mixed with
the plain dress of this country, at once reflect the peculiarities
of these nations.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was the grandest reception that has ever happened
in this city. But all these things are not the object of
my information; the only thing which I intend to inform
you is that there was a punch, to your astonishment, and thus
to the satisfaction of all the hosts. Indeed, the iced Californian
claret was the only drinkable matter, besides several
kinds of cold meats and dessert.</p>

<p>I cannot keep this event in myself for so many days, seeing
that you have been so anxious to know. Details I will reserve
till the Monday evening when I shall meet you.</p>

<p class="right2">Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Maru Takasaki</span>.</p></div>

<p>“Maru Takasaki,” repeated Ogden. “Is he the
new <i>attaché</i> of the Japanese Embassy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and he is so pleased with his progress in
English that he wishes me to give lessons to his
wife, who has just arrived from Japan. They have
taken a house two blocks from here and have just
moved in.”</p>

<p>“I predict you will shortly have more pupils than
you can handle,” and Mrs. Ogden smiled at Ethel’s
enthusiasm. “But you must not be so busy that you
cannot be nice to my cousin”&mdash;she stopped speaking
as the butler approached her husband and commenced
whispering in his ear. “What is it, Walter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“You say he’s <i>here</i>?” asked Ogden, paying no
attention to his wife’s question.</p>

<p>“Yes, sor,” and Charles, the butler, laid a visiting
card in front of Ogden. “At the door, sor.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” Ogden dropped his napkin and
gazed blankly across at his wife. “He’s come&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;who? Not&mdash;&mdash;” Eager welcome in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“No one you know,” responded Ogden. “The
owner of this house&mdash;Professor Richard Norcross&mdash;has
come to occupy ‘Blue Beard’s Chamber.’”</p>

<p>“Well!” Mrs. Ogden blinked in astonishment.
“What a mercy I put on my most becoming morning
gown. Ask him in to breakfast, Walter,” and,
as her husband left the room, she added hastily,
“Don’t desert me, Ethel.”</p>

<p>“I really ought to be at Mrs. Henderson’s in
twenty minutes, Cousin Jane,” expostulated Ethel,
but she lingered a moment longer to fold her napkin,
and the next second Ogden had entered, followed by
Professor Norcross.</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you not to look upon my
arrival as an intrusion,” said the professor, after
greeting Mrs. Ogden and Ethel. “I sent word to
my agent to notify you, Mrs. Ogden, that the law
required that I make a brief visit to Washington.”</p>

<p>“We shall try and make your stay pleasant,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>answered Mrs. Ogden cordially. She was agreeably
impressed with the professor’s scholarly
appearance. “Charles, bring some hot coffee. Oh,
don’t go, Ethel,” as the latter moved toward the
door.</p>

<p>“I really must, Cousin Jane, I’ll be back in time
for luncheon,” and nodding a smiling farewell to the
men, Ethel whisked out of the dining room.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Ethel opened the front door
of the house with more than her accustomed impetuosity
and ran into the arms of a distinguished looking
stranger.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” gasped Ethel, straightening
her hat which had tilted at a rakish angle on encountering
the stranger’s forehead. “The butler
will be here in an instant; oh, here he is now&mdash;&mdash;”
and Ethel dashed down the steps.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to see Mr. Ogden?” inquired
Charles, but his question passed unheard, as Julian
Barclay gazed after Ethel;&mdash;he had found the girl
of the miniature.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT THE JAPANESE EMBASSY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>idnight</span> was fast approaching, but the reception
at the Japanese Embassy showed no
signs of diminished attendance or lack of enjoyment
among the guests. Diplomatic and official Washington
was present to do honor to the Mikado’s birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ogden and their guests
were among the late arrivals, and Ethel Ogden received
a warm welcome from Maru Takasaki, who
hastened to greet her, and, with an air of great pride,
presented her to his wife. Madame Takasaki’s
pretty face broke into a friendly smile and she shook
Ethel’s hand with marked cordiality.</p>

<p>“You so nice to Mr. Takasaki,” she lisped, with
a delicious accent. “He tell me of long white lady
who teaches him.”</p>

<p>Ethel cast a startled look at a wall mirror which
reflected back her blond beauty, and the Japanese’s
description of a “tall blonde” brought a smile to her
lips and her eyes danced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“And how do you like America, O Takasaki-San?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“So much,” Madame Takasaki raised her hands
as if measuring her meaning. “American people so
nice,” she smiled and nodded at her questioner.
“But it so strange they have so large noses, the noses
give me terror.” Ethel, following Madame Takasaki’s
glance, laughed outright; truly her compatriots’
noses did appear large when compared to the
small features of the Japanese. The arrival of
Maru Takasaki, who had left them a few minutes
before, with another Japanese prevented her reply,
and she was introduced to Mr. Saito who, Madame
Takasaki explained, had arrived only that morning.</p>

<p>“You speak Japanese, Mees Ogden?” inquired
Saito.</p>

<p>Ethel recalled a phrase she had picked up in
looking over a Japanese-Italian phrase book, meaning,
“Not yet,” and in a spirit of mischief, she
responded, “<i>Mada-mada</i>,” then dimly wondered at
the alteration in her companion’s manner. But
Julian Barclay’s abrupt arrival gave her no time to
question Saito.</p>

<p>“Won’t you go into supper with me, Miss
Ogden?” demanded Barclay eagerly.</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I cannot,” Ethel’s eyes sparkled at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>the disappointment which Barclay made no attempt
to hide. “But perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes?” eagerly, as she stopped tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“I see there is dancing in the ballroom, and after
supper&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ll dance with me?” eager anticipation in his
voice.</p>

<p>“If you are good.” Ethel turned to include Mr.
Saito in their conversation, but he had moved over
to the ambassador’s side and was talking eagerly
to him and Maru Takasaki. They turned simultaneously
and looked at Ethel and she was surprised
by the concentration of their gaze. Angered by
their staring, she turned abruptly to Barclay. “I
promised to go out to supper with Professor Norcross.
Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Not since we reached here,” moodily. “He
monopolized you shamefully all this evening. Can’t
think what you see in the old fogy.”</p>

<p>“Why, he is most entertaining,” protested Ethel.
“He has traveled all over the globe and in the most
interesting places. And he isn’t old, not over&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sixty!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” indignantly. “I don’t believe he is
forty-five. It’s those glasses he wears which give
him a venerable air; if you examine his face you will
find it quite young&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take your word for it; can’t waste time examining
<i>his</i> face,” and Barclay’s gaze never left
Ethel. “Don’t move, Miss Ogden,” he entreated.
“Against that background of wonderful old silk
hangings you’d made a lovely miniature.”</p>

<p>“Flatterer!” Ethel’s eyes sank under his ardent
look. “I’ll never achieve a miniature; they are too
expensive.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that your family or friends
have never had your miniature painted?” asked
Barclay incredulously, and his hand felt the small
gold miniature case tucked securely inside a concealed
pocket of his dress suit. If the miniature
had fascinated him, its living prototype had bewitched
him, he admitted with secret rage, but he
could no more tear himself away from Ethel’s vicinity
than the proverbial moth can ignore the candle.
“Never had your miniature painted?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Never,” Ethel laughed faintly at his persistent
vehemence. “Awfully short-sighted of them to overlook
such a thing of beauty,” she mocked. Like
most really beautiful women, Ethel rarely thought
of it. But she was aware of a charm, all her own,
for it had smoothed life for her since childhood.
Her blue eyes, which met every gaze with frank
interest, were made for laughter, but in moments
of stress their glance deepened, and she was rarely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>deceived by specious flattery or the equally treacherous
frankness which often covers deceit. Her
pale golden hair was her crowning beauty which,
with the unconscious grace of her every movement
made her presence felt however or wherever she
appeared. “Here comes Professor Norcross,”
she announced, glancing down the room.</p>

<p>“Then I’m going,” ejaculated Barclay. “Don’t
forget those dances,” and he disappeared behind
the portières as the professor pushed his way
through the throng and joined Ethel.</p>

<p>“Curious, morose sort of chap, Barclay,” observed
Norcross. “What made him leave you so
suddenly? I asked,” he hastened to explain, seeing
her surprise at the question, “because I have a feeling
that Barclay is avoiding me.”</p>

<p>“Why should you think that?” parried Ethel. She
had observed Barclay’s distrait manner and lapse
into silence whenever the professor appeared, and
the situation was commencing to pique her curiosity.
Not getting an immediate reply to her question she
changed the subject. “Suppose we go out to supper,”
she suggested, and Norcross accompanied her
across the room. They found the dining room too
crowded for comfort, and at Norcross’ suggestion
Ethel remained near the entrance, while he went in
search of an ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Their progress toward the dining room had been
attentively watched by the ambassador who, exchanging
greetings with his guests, imperceptibly
followed Ethel and reached her side just as the professor
left her.</p>

<p>“Ah, Miss Ogden,” he said. “Why have you
never confided to me that you speak Japanese, when
instructing my wife in English?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t speak Japanese,” protested Ethel,
somewhat bewildered. Her charming personality
had won her a friendly footing in their household
and the regard of both the ambassador and his wife,
and she had particularly enjoyed having the latter
for a pupil the year before.</p>

<p>“But, Miss Ogden, you answered Mr. Saito in
Japanese,” answered the ambassador, regarding
her steadily.</p>

<p>Ethel laughed. “I picked up the phrase ‘<i>mada-mada</i>’
in one of your textbooks,” she explained.</p>

<p>“But that is very clever,” and the ambassador
looked at her with a new respect.</p>

<p>“Frankly,” Ethel’s love of fun got the better
of her, “Your Excellency, I am a very clever
woman,” and she laughed at his serious reception
of her jesting. “But no one has discovered it until
now. I thank you for the compliment.”</p>

<p>The ambassador bowed gravely and started to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>speak, but the arrival of a Cabinet officer caused
him to turn hastily away, and Ethel welcomed Professor
Norcross and his cooling ice with unaffected
pleasure.</p>

<p>“I think the Japanese are the most inquisitive,
suspicious people I’ve ever encountered,” she confided
to him. “They pursue the same idea for hours
and hours. I’ll never be able to convince Mr. Saito
that my knowledge of Japanese is limited to three
or four words. Now, if I were an accomplished
linguist like Mr. Barclay&mdash;gracious, I wonder what
the ambassador would say if he knew Mr. Barclay
speaks Japanese.”</p>

<p>Norcross laid down his spoon on his empty plate.
“You heard him, then, speak Japanese?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as we were entering the house. Have
you known Mr. Barclay for a long time?”</p>

<p>“No, I never met him until two nights ago on the
train coming to Washington,” replied Norcross,
handing Ethel a glass of lemonade and surrendering
his empty plate to a servant.</p>

<p>“It was quite a coincidence that you should both
be traveling together toward the same house and
never realize it until you met there,” commented
Ethel. The crush was thinning out, and in the comparative
silence, strains of music floated to them
from the ballroom, and her foot unconsciously beat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>time. Norcross caught the direction her eyes were
straying, and spoke more quickly than customary.</p>

<p>“You dance, Miss Ogden?”</p>

<p>“With me,” announced Barclay just back of
them, and Norcross colored at the curtness of his
tone.</p>

<p>“I have promised this dance to Mr. Barclay,”
explained Ethel hurriedly, half resentful of Barclay’s
air of proprietorship.</p>

<p>“Then will you give me the next?” asked Norcross.</p>

<p>“Surely,” and smiling a gay farewell, Ethel laid
her hand on Barclay’s arm and they walked in the
direction of the ballroom. Norcross watched them
out of sight, then strolled over to the buffet and
secured a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Ethel was one of the best dancers in Washington,
and to her delight found Barclay equally proficient.
At the end of the dance, when the
orchestra played an encore, she agreed with enthusiasm
to Barclay’s request that they continue, and
Barclay, his eyes seldom straying from his beautiful
companion, forgetful of all vexing problems and
ignoring prudence, danced as he had seldom danced
before.</p>

<p>Ethel’s absorption in the dance made her oblivious
of the presence of a tall, burly man who stood by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>Mrs. Ogden and answered the latter’s remarks in
haphazard fashion. Her companion’s inattention
was not lost on Mrs. Ogden, and she smiled to
herself on catching the direction of his gaze.</p>

<p>“Ethel looks very lovely tonight, Mr. Patterson,”
she remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>very</i>,” and the emphasis on the adjective
satisfied her match-making mind; Representative
Patterson most certainly wore his heart on his
sleeve, and gossip for once appeared right; he was
undoubtedly in love with Ethel. “Who is the man
she is dancing with?” he questioned a moment later.
“His face appears familiar, but I cannot place
him.”</p>

<p>“My cousin, Julian Barclay.” Mrs. Ogden made
room for Patterson on the settee she was sharing
with another dowager. “Just returned from Panama,
and I haven’t seen him for years. He has
taken a great fancy to Ethel,” with a sidelong glance
at Patterson. Mrs. Ogden had decided to hurry
Fate. “We have such a jolly house party now that
Julian and Professor Norcross have joined us.”</p>

<p>“Norcross, the naturalist?” Mrs. Ogden nodded.
“He is a clever man. I am puzzled by your cousin;
I feel sure that I have met him somewhere.” Patterson’s
heavy eyebrows met in a frown. “And
he is the type of man not easily forgotten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll introduce you to him, and then you can
compare notes,” volunteered Mrs. Ogden, catching
Ethel’s eye, and beckoning to her.</p>

<p>“Cousin Jane seems to want us,” said Ethel, and
Barclay looked in the direction indicated. Ethel’s
hand was still on his arm, and she felt the muscles
stiffen. She looked up startled, to learn nothing
from his blank expression.</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me another dance?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;later,” Ethel dodged an awkward
couple who threatened to careen against her as they
danced past, and made her way down the room.
“Good evening, Jim,” she exclaimed, stopping by
her cousin. Her extended hand was eagerly clasped
as Patterson welcomed her enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Patterson&mdash;my cousin, Mr. Barclay,”
chimed in Mrs. Ogden, and releasing Ethel’s hand
reluctantly, Patterson turned to greet Barclay.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we met before?” he asked, and his gray
eyes scanned Barclay intently.</p>

<p>“It may be,” Barclay’s cheery smile was almost
boyish. “Were you in Chicago two years ago?”</p>

<p>“N-no,” thoughtfully. “I think not.”</p>

<p>“You two can reminisce later on,” interrupted
Mrs. Ogden hastily. “At present, Julian, I wish
to introduce you to Miss Van Alstyne,” and before
Barclay could protest he found himself before an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>extremely plain girl who accepted his request for a
dance almost before it was spoken.</p>

<p>Patterson watched Barclay depart with a thoughtful
frown, then turned to Ethel.</p>

<p>“Suppose we sit out this dance,” he suggested.
“I want to talk to you, to have you all to myself,”
and Ethel read in his expression the longing he
did not strive to conceal from her.</p>

<p>She had twice refused Jim Patterson, but he had
declined to accept dismissal, pleading that his great
love for her must eventually bring in return a like
affection. His dogged persistence had won her respect
and liking, and she had, with a determination
almost fierce, nearly convinced herself that her liking
was becoming something warmer, stronger; but tonight&mdash;Ethel
closed her eyes as if in pain.</p>

<p>“I wish to dance,” she announced, and Patterson,
angered by her imperious tone, of which, to do her
justice, she was totally unconscious, placed his arm
about her and swung her into the dancing throng.</p>

<p>But as Ethel kept step to the music her heart was
in hot revolt. What influence was at work to upset
her resolution? Why could she not marry Jim Patterson?
He was generous, chivalrous; surely to
accept his offer of marriage was to insure not only
her future happiness, but the welfare of her invalid
father and delicate mother. Other girls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>married to secure the ease of mind and comfort
which money could bring. She had not wantonly
encouraged Jim Patterson; two refusals could not
be construed as leading him on to a flirtation. He
knew she did not love him; but their tastes coincided;
surely her liking for him would bridge the matrimonial
chasm as well as love? A word&mdash;one little
word&mdash;</p>

<p>Patterson, who had been dancing in silence, drew
Ethel closer to avoid collision with another couple,
and the nearness of her presence broke down his
anger.</p>

<p>“Give me my answer, Ethel?” he whispered in
her ear. “Say I have a chance?”</p>

<p>A loud burst of laughter near them drowned her
reply, and as Patterson bent nearer, she faltered,
recovered herself, and stammered brokenly:</p>

<p>“I can’t, Jim; it’s just impossible.”</p>

<p>In bitter disappointment Patterson straightened
up, and thereby missed the look exchanged between
Ethel and Julian Barclay, whom chance and the
dance had brought by their side. Ethel’s heart was
beating with suffocating rapidity as she passed down
the room. What witchery lurked in Julian Barclay’s
dark eyes to alter her preordained destiny?</p>

<p>Barclay surrendered Miss Van Alstyne to her next
partner with a thankful heart and outward regret,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>and avoiding Mrs. Ogden, made his way out of the
ballroom. He was in no mood for talking; he
wished to think&mdash;and dream&mdash;of Ethel Ogden.
Why had she looked at him so strangely when
chance brought them together in the dance? Was
it deep calling to deep? With difficulty he curbed
his desire to rush to her. Madness and matrimony
both commenced with the same letter, he reminded
himself bitterly, and in honor he must banish all
thought of Ethel Ogden and settle his mind to solving
the problems confronting him. Not the least
of these problems was the miniature. Ethel had
denied having had one painted, but it might have
been done from a photograph without her knowledge&mdash;the
real mystery was why her miniature had been
placed in his pocket, by whom, and how?</p>

<p>On the arrival of the Washington, New Orleans,
and San Francisco Express that morning at the National
Capital, Barclay, with Dr. Shively and Professor
Norcross had made a deposition of the events
relating to Dwight Tilghman’s death. Barclay had
been the last to be heard by the coroner and the
notary, and when he left the Union Station, Shively
was in deep conversation with Dr. Leonard McLane
who had just arrived, and Barclay forebore to interrupt
them. Norcross was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Barclay had given his Washington address to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>coroner, but had not mentioned it to either Shively
or Norcross, and his astonishment at finding Norcross
also a guest at the Ogdens’ was as great as
the professor’s surprise at seeing him so soon again.
Beyond exchanging a few words with him, Barclay
gave his entire attention to extracting information
about Ethel from his cousin, Mrs. Ogden. The
unexpected discovery of the identity of the unknown
girl of the miniature acted as a spur to his keen
desire to penetrate the riddle of Dwight Tilghman’s
murder and the disappearance of his silver flask;
but what bearing his involuntary acquisition of the
miniature had upon these two events he could not
conceive.</p>

<p>Refusing a glass of champagne, Barclay wandered
through the dining room, which was becoming
crowded again with the ceasing of the dancing, and
as his eyes traveled about the room, he encountered
the fixed stare of a Japanese standing by one of
the doorways.</p>

<p>“Ito, by all that’s wonderful!” ejaculated Barclay
under his breath and plunged forward. But two
stout dowagers stepped in his way and delayed him,
and by the time he had elbowed his way to the door
the Japanese was not in sight.</p>

<p>Barclay paused in perplexity. “It surely was
Ito,” he muttered. “And yet the Japs look so alike
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>I can’t swear”&mdash;he paused to scan several Japanese
who stood talking near him. Ito certainly was not
in that group, and turning, Barclay walked down the
hall. He found a room opening off it half way
along, and on impulse pulled back the portières and
entered.</p>

<p>The room, empty except for himself, was obviously
a den or library; handsome bookcases lined
the walls, comfortable lounging chairs and a few
small tables stood about, while on the hearth a wood
fire burned cheerily, and the light from the electric
lamps was reflected back from handsome silver ornaments
lying on the desk which stood in the center
of the room.</p>

<p>Barclay, realizing the room was not open for
guests, started to retreat, when he caught sight of
a silver flask lying among the desk ornaments, and
moved by curiosity he picked it up and examined
the intricate scroll work by aid of the droplight.
The design was identical with the chrysanthemum
pattern on his flask. In every way, style and size,
the two flasks were mates, if not the same.</p>

<p>Barclay started as the bare possibility occurred
to him, and broke into a profuse perspiration.
Pshaw! he was mad! He had last seen his flask in
the possession of Dwight Tilghman on the express
train&mdash;it was beyond probability to find it on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>desk of the Japanese Ambassador! Beyond probability,
yes; but not beyond possibility&mdash;had he not
seen Ito in the dining room, and evidence went to
prove that Ito had poisoned Tilghman. If he had
placed that poison in Barclay’s flask, what more
likely than his leaving such incriminating evidence
where it might never be found and traced?</p>

<p>Barclay held the flask up to the light and tilted
it. A little liquid remained in it, and he came to
a quick decision.</p>

<p>On entering the room Barclay had failed to note
that at its far corner it opened into a conservatory,
and as he pocketed the flask, he did not see the red
glow of a cigar among the leaves of the tropical
plants.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LESSON</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo</span> weeks had glided by and Julian Barclay
was no nearer solving the mystery surrounding
the death of Dwight Tilghman than the day the crime
was committed. He had turned in despair to a more
fascinating enigma&mdash;Ethel Ogden; and too late he
realized that she was becoming all in all to him,
and his stifled conscience gave him little peace when
away from her bewitching presence. Ethel, to the
secret indignation of her cousin, Mrs. Ogden, did
not discourage his attentions, closing her eyes to
the future and to James Patterson’s growing fury.</p>

<p>“You must talk to her, Jane,” declared Walter
Ogden, as Ethel bidding them a laughing good-by,
left the house to give her Tuesday morning lesson
to Maru Takasaki. “This flirtation cannot keep
up. Ethel is treating Jim Patterson shamefully if,
as you have given me to understand”&mdash;shooting a
keen look at her from under his shaggy eyebrows,
“Ethel has virtually accepted him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden flushed; she was prone to exaggeration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
and with her to wish a thing was often to state
its materialization.</p>

<p>“I am greatly surprised at Ethel,” she replied,
carefully avoiding a direct answer. “She must
realize the desirability of the match. Aside from
Mr. Patterson’s agreeable personality&mdash;why, every
mother with marriageable daughters has angled for
him&mdash;he is madly in love with Ethel, I know <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then, if such is the case there is certainly no
excuse for Ethel’s playing Barclay against him,”
Ogden dug his pen viciously into the inkstand. “It’s
a great pity, Jane, that you ever invited Barclay
here; wasn’t there some old scandal”&mdash;and he
puckered his forehead in thought.</p>

<p>“Mercy, that’s long since lived down and forgotten,”
exclaimed Mrs. Ogden cheerily, but she had
paled and her husband observed it in silence. “I’ve
never had an opportunity to return the Barclays’
kindness to me when I most needed assistance&mdash;before
I met you, dear,” kissing him affectionately.
“This is the first hospitality I’ve ever shown Julian.”</p>

<p>“That is not your fault,” said Ogden impatiently.
“Julian apparently has chosen to ignore his relatives,
until his letter to you last month out of a clear
sky, and you are under no obligation to assist his
idle flirtation with my cousin, Ethel. I advise your
giving him a hint that he terminate his visit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>“Walter!” But Mrs. Ogden’s scandalized expression
was lost on her husband, who was busy
casting up a long array of figures. “I shall do nothing
so inhospitable. No, Ethel must work out her
own salvation. I”&mdash;primly, “never interfere in other
people’s affairs.”</p>

<p>Ogden smiled, not unkindly. “Then send Ethel
to me, or better still, I’ll talk to Barclay.”</p>

<p>“You must not put all the blame on Julian,” protested
Mrs. Ogden, quick to resent another’s
disapproval of her cousin, although secretly displeased
with him. She was longing for the <i>éclat</i>
which a fashionable wedding would give her in
Washington society, and had already planned to
ask Ethel and Representative Patterson to hold
their wedding in her house. And now her own
cousin had come along and threatened by his inconsiderate
flirtation to upset her social campaign.
“Walter,” moving nearer her husband and lowering
her voice, “has it not struck you that Professor
Norcross is <i>épris</i> with Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Norcross?” Ogden leaned back and indulged
in a dry chuckle. “My dear Jane, your imagination
is working overtime.”</p>

<p>“Well, he got married once!”</p>

<p>Ogden chuckled again. “Jane, romancing is your
forte. If you are not careful,” shaking an admonitory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
finger at his wife, “you may imagine I have
fallen a victim to Ethel’s charms. Now, run along,
and leave me to my accounts. How often must
I tell you that I cannot be interrupted by trivialities?”</p>

<p>“Why, you commenced the argument,” protested
Mrs. Ogden, but ten years of married life had
taught her the uselessness of combating her husband’s
wishes, and she reluctantly withdrew. Ogden
did not at once resume his perusal of his business
affairs.</p>

<p>“What was it I heard about Julian Barclay,”
he muttered. “For a chatterbox Jane is marvelously
close-mouthed where her relatives are concerned.”</p>

<p>Two blocks away Ethel Ogden was indulging in
bitter reflections, in which Jim Patterson and Julian
Barclay largely figured&mdash;much to the detriment of
the English lesson. But Maru Takasaki came of a
patient race, and neither by word or sign betrayed
his knowledge of Ethel’s inattention or the flight of
time.</p>

<p>“The President leaves tomorrow for California,”
announced Ethel, awakening from her day dreams.</p>

<p>“Is it so?” and Takasaki took up his pencil, his
voice expressing mild surprise.</p>

<p>“He is not really going,” explained Ethel, her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>face dimpling into a smile. “I used the first sentence
that came into my head for dictation purposes.
I suppose to mention the Mikado in such a manner
would be <i>lèse majesté</i> in your country?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying Takasaki contented himself
with writing out the dictation in his precise, careful
writing, and Ethel, leaning across the table examined
the paper with interest.</p>

<p>“Very well done,” she said. “I think I have gotten
you to remember the definite and indefinite
articles.”</p>

<p>“I thank you so much.” Takasaki’s deferential
bow always delighted Ethel, it was the only thing
expressive and individual about the Japanese. “My
wife, who studied at the English school for the
highborn in Nippon, predicts that I do well.”</p>

<p>“Madame Takasaki is a very earnest scholar,”
commented Ethel. “It delights me to see her pegging
away so silently.”</p>

<p>“Pegging?” Takasaki eyed Ethel in puzzled surprise,
the word did not fit into his knowledge of
English; then a grieved look crept into his eyes, and
he said in a tone of the blankest astonishment.
“Mees Ogden, did you ever hear a noise I made?”</p>

<p>Ethel hastened to reassure him. “No, I never
did,” she said with honest vehemence. “You and
your wife are the most silent pupils I have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Takasaki bowed. “May we talk?” he asked as
Ethel picked up a textbook.</p>

<p>“Surely. Tell me of your impressions of the
mobilization of our fleet in Hampton Roads.”</p>

<p>“Grand, majestic,” replied Takasaki. “Such a
harbor! I see you there for a glimpse at the hotel?”
The last was unmistakably an interrogation.</p>

<p>“Yes. My cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Ogden,
Professor Norcross, Mr. Barclay and I made up a
party and went down to Old Point Comfort. I
have an idea,” Ethel examined her pencil with care,
“that Mr. Barclay must have spent much time in
Japan.”</p>

<p>“So?” was Takasaki’s only comment.</p>

<p>“Have you ever met him in the East?” asked
Ethel, choosing directness as the only method of
getting an answer from the Japanese.</p>

<p>Takasaki pondered her question. “I think not,”
he answered. “Mr. James Patterson, yes; he came
with a party from your Congress.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Patterson, oh, yes, he is very much interested
in the Eastern question,” Ethel pulled herself
up short; Jim Patterson’s interest in the Japanese
was far from complimentary, and his endeavors had
been to assist legislation for their exclusion from
the country. To discuss him and his opinions would
be in the present company a ticklish subject. “Well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>what did you think of our battleships?” she queried,
anxious to get away from dangerous ground.</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” the Japanese raised his hands in
a characteristic gesture. “You say Mr. Barclay
travel much in Nippon?”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe so,” Ethel gathered up her belongings
preparatory to leaving. “But he has never
told me much about his travels. It just occurred
to me that perhaps you had met him before coming
to Washington.”</p>

<p>Takasaki shook his head. “You forget I in
Diplomatic Service,” he said speaking more quickly
than usual, and dropping his precise and formal
English. “I seldom in Nippon.”</p>

<p>“True.” Ethel concealed her disappointment.
She was gradually awakening to the realization that
Julian Barclay was absorbing her thoughts to the
exclusion of all else, and to her consternation his
name invariably cropped up in her conversations
if he was not present.</p>

<p>A discreet tap sounded on the door, and at Takasaki’s
command a man servant stepped into the
drawing room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barclay call for the Honorable Miss,” he
announced.</p>

<p>Ethel colored hotly as she rose in some haste.
“You make my lessons so agreeable, Mr. Takasaki,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>she said. “I never realize when the time is up.”</p>

<p>“You so kind,” the Japanese bowed low over
her hand. “Why not wait and permit that Mr.
Barclay be entertained. My wife, she better, and
be down in a little second.” Turning to the servant
he gave a rapid order in his native tongue,
and bowing, the Japanese servant withdrew, to return
almost immediately with Julian Barclay.</p>

<p>Ethel watched the greeting between the two men,
but learned nothing from Barclay’s sauvely polite
manner and Takasaki’s changeless expression; if
they had met before there was no indication of it
in words and behavior.</p>

<p>“Mees Ogden tells that you visit in Nippon,”
said Takasaki, and Ethel again colored warmly;
what must Barclay think of her for discussing him
with the Japanese?</p>

<p>“I stopped there en route to the Philippines some
years ago,” said Barclay. “I was greatly interested
in your embroideries, tapestries, and works
of art.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Many Americans buy our art work,
and we are left without.”</p>

<p>“But in your progressive land there must be
skilled workmen who duplicate the curios and sell
them to tourists as originals, are there not?” questioned
Barclay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that Yankee ingenuity abides in
the land of the chrysanthemum,” protested Ethel.</p>

<p>Takasaki smiled broadly. “There live deceivers
in every land; but it not possible for the antiques to
be made again; the design of which is a lost art.”</p>

<p>“How about silver ornaments&mdash;flasks?” Barclay’s
eyes never left the Japanese. “I bought one,
curiously shaped, with a chrysanthemum pattern
traced upon it, and believed it to be the only one of
its kind. And yet, I have seen two of these flasks
within two weeks.”</p>

<p>“We no have silver flasks in Nippon,” replied
Takasaki quietly. “We have saki bottles&mdash;you
mean those? No? Then you no buy silver flask
in Nippon.” Takasaki’s tone of finality caused
Ethel to stare at the two men, and she grew aware
of an under-current of antagonism between them,
and like the born diplomat that she was, instantly
plunged into the conversation.</p>

<p>“I should love to own some real Japanese
jewelry,” she said. “I imagine it must be very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“We no have jewelry,” announced Takasaki,
smiling at her enthusiasm. “Only coat ornaments,
neck charms, but no rings&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then this must be Chinese.” As he spoke Barclay
drew a ring from his little finger and passed it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>to the Japanese, who carried it to the window to
inspect it in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful piece of jade!” exclaimed
Ethel peeping over his shoulder. “It is so green,
and what a unique setting!”</p>

<p>The jade, cut almost square, was set high in
solid gold, and a dragon, heavily carved in the
gold, was coiled around the jade, its head and claws
overlapping the brilliant green stone.</p>

<p>“The ring is made by hand,” volunteered Takasaki,
after a brief silence, and turning it over and
over. “A Chinese curio&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And if I am not mistaken, a woman’s ring,” supplemented
Barclay. “It is very small, and barely
fits my little finger.”</p>

<p>“Has it no legend?” asked Ethel.</p>

<p>“It was perhaps worn by the highborn many many
years ago,” said Takasaki. “In Nippon I have believed
what you call”&mdash;he thought a moment for the
word he wanted&mdash;“tradition, which says that jade
for the woman wearer on the coats is a token of
love’s loyalty.”</p>

<p>“And for the man?” asked Barclay, accepting the
ring and slipping it on his little finger.</p>

<p>“For the man”&mdash;again Takasaki paused, and his
face was unsmiling, “it signifies betrayal and death.”</p>

<p>“What a very gloomy outlook!” laughed Barclay,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>inspecting the ring on his finger. “I am glad your
tradition is more kind to the woman, and grants
her”&mdash;his eyes sought Ethel&mdash;“love’s loyalty.”</p>

<p>“We Nipponese are loyal to our gods, our country,
and our women,” Takasaki’s tone was almost a
rebuke in its seriousness. “Betrayal merits death.”</p>

<p>“Quite so.” Barclay stooped over to pick up
Ethel’s fur muff, and she missed seeing his expression.
“Let me carry those books, Miss Ogden?”
putting out a hand toward a small pile of them on
the table.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but the books stay here for Mr.
Takasaki,” smiling at their host. “You will write
that composition before the next lesson.”</p>

<p>“But yes.” They moved toward the hall and
Barclay dropped behind for a second. “My wife&mdash;”
Takasaki turned about and waited for Barclay to
catch up with them. “She will be at the next lesson.
When you come to Nippon again, Mr. Barclay, do
not only look at curios.”</p>

<p>Ethel darted a look at the two men&mdash;her quick
ear had caught a hint of menace in Takasaki’s
monotonous voice, but his expression was devoid of
meaning. Barclay’s cheery smile reassured her.</p>

<p>“I’ll follow your advice, Mr. Takasaki,” replied
Barclay, passing out of the front door held open
by the attentive servant. “But I hardly expect to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>visit Japan again. Good morning,” and the door
closed behind him.</p>

<p>Barclay caught up to Ethel and suited his step
to hers. “We have plenty of time,” he coaxed.
“Let’s go over to the Corcoran Gallery. There is
an exhibition of Japanese paintings which I particularly
want you to see.”</p>

<p>But Ethel shook her head. “Don’t tempt me to
be idle,” she said. “I have letters to write for
Cousin Jane. You”&mdash;with a kindly glance for his
evident disappointment&mdash;“can come with me if you
wish?”</p>

<p>“If I wish!” he echoed with such emphasis that
both laughed involuntarily. Before he could say
more Ethel sprang on board an up-town electric car,
and to his chagrin he had no opportunity in the
crowded street car to exchange further words with
her. On reaching the Ogden residence Ethel went
at once to Walter Ogden’s den on the second floor.</p>

<p>“Claiming the privilege of cousinship, I am coming
in, too,” announced Barclay from the doorway.
“I feel sure I can help you get rid of those letters”&mdash;pointing
to several lying on a desk.</p>

<p>“Come in,” replied Ethel, seating herself and
sorting writing paper and pens. “But, oh, please
don’t talk.”</p>

<p>Barclay did not need the injunction&mdash;to sit and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>look at Ethel had become a matter of habit and
happiness with him, and he watched her deft fingers
cover page after page with legible but stylish writing
with never flagging interest, and the intensity
of his regard brought an added light to her eyes.</p>

<p>It was the first time Barclay had been in the large
costly furnished room which, opening out of Walter
Ogden’s bedroom, he had taken for an upstairs
sitting room, and which Mrs. Ogden had promptly
called the den. Ethel had been installed there soon
after her arrival, and her art metal typewriting desk,
which she had brought with her as well as her
Underwood typewriter, had been placed midway
between the hall door and the entrance to Ogden’s
bedroom. She had been somewhat upset over being
so far from the light, but Ogden had given her a
powerful electric droplight and that had helped her
materially. Ogden’s own desk, a massive affair,
occupied the space between the two windows, while
Mrs. Ogden’s lounge, a bookcase filled with light
literature, a highboy, several tables, and numerous
upholstered chairs and a small fireplace took up
most of the space in the room.</p>

<p>“What are you searching for?” asked Barclay,
breaking his long silence.</p>

<p>“Cousin Jane’s seal.” Ethel laid the sealing wax
down on the desk and searched diligently among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>her papers. “How provoking! The notes are all
written, and I cannot send them off until they are
sealed&mdash;Cousin Jane’s latest fad,” she added in explanation.
“And the invitations must be sent out
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Use this,” Barclay, drawing his chair nearer,
removed his Chinese ring and laid it in Ethel’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t I ruin the stone?”</p>

<p>“I think not, the dealer said it could be used as
a seal.”</p>

<p>Ethel again examined the ring. “I think he was
wrong,” she announced. “I would be afraid to use
it&mdash;the jade is too beautiful.”</p>

<p>“You admire it then?” eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very much; it is unique,” proffering it back
again, and Barclay held the ring against the whiteness
of her hand.</p>

<p>“It will be becoming to you,” he said, and before
she guessed his intention, he had slipped it on her
finger. “Ah, I was right; don’t remove it.”</p>

<p>Ethel laughed unsteadily. “I never accept presents
of value from acquaintances.”</p>

<p>Barclay drew back as if struck. “Acquaintances?”
he repeated. “Ah, no, never. Say friends,
Ethel”&mdash;and neither noticed the use of her first
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Well, friends,” Ethel’s voice shook a trifle, and
she strove to change the conversation. “Your ring
is too large.”</p>

<p>“But it can be made smaller,” quickly. “See, it
is too tight for me,” indicating his little finger and
the redness of the skin where the ring had been.</p>

<p>Ethel leaned forward and glanced at the strong
slender fingers spread wide before her. “You have
the hand of a surgeon,” she remarked. “Why
have you stopped wearing the ring on your right
hand?”</p>

<p>“How can you tell that?” and Barclay scrutinized
her keenly.</p>

<p>“By the worn circle around the little finger of
the right hand.”</p>

<p>Barclay bent nearer. “If that is an indication, I
must find out how many you are accustomed to
wear,” he announced, and Ethel laughed softly.</p>

<p>“I never wear rings,” spreading her fingers.
“See, no marks.”</p>

<p>“But you will wear mine?” insistently, and then
as her face paled, he added more lightly, “On humanitarian
grounds.”</p>

<p>“I don’t catch your meaning?” in puzzled surprise.</p>

<p>“Takasaki has just told us that jade is unlucky
for a man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Well, if it’s to ward off the evil eye,” laughed
Ethel, “I may consent to keep it.”</p>

<p>“I have your word for it?” with quick impetuosity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” blushing as her eyes met his.</p>

<p>Barclay drew a long breath. “For the woman
wearer it betokens love’s loyalty,” he quoted, and
his hands imprisoned hers.</p>

<p>“Loyalty,” faltered Ethel, her eyes on the ring.</p>

<p>“And love,” he supplemented steadily, though his
heart was beating almost to suffocation. “Ethel,
my darling&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A heavy step in the adjoining room and the banging
of a door brought Ethel to her feet and
snatching her hands from Barclay’s detaining clasp
she slipped from the room as her cousin, Walter
Ogden, entered by the other door.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>alter Ogden</span> stopped on the threshold
of the den and regarded Julian Barclay with
open displeasure.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Julian, this won’t do,” he said,
slamming the door behind him and taking the
seat left vacant by Ethel. “I don’t object to a
little harmless flirtation, but you apparently forget
that Ethel Ogden is engaged to James Patterson.”</p>

<p>Barclay whitened and his clear dark eyes contracted
with sudden uncontrollable anguish; then
mastering his emotion, he faced the older man with
his usual nonchalant manner.</p>

<p>“I was not aware, Ogden, that&mdash;that&mdash;Miss
Ogden was engaged to be married,” he began and
stopped, uncertain of his ability to keep his voice
expressionless.</p>

<p>“I quite understand,” put in Ogden, more kindly.
“Ethel is greatly to blame&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” the contradiction rang out clearly, and this
time there was no mistaking the look in Barclay’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>eyes. “Miss Ogden is entirely blameless. It was
my joy in her society which made me”&mdash;speaking
more slowly&mdash;“blind to the situation.”</p>

<p>Ogden did not reply at once, and Barclay stared
steadily out of the window through which the noon-sunshine
crept in ever increasing volume, but to him
the day had become gray and cheerless. Ogden’s
voice aroused him from his bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>“When are you returning to the East?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t made any definite plans,” Barclay
glanced at the mantel clock. “If you will excuse
me, Ogden,” rising, “I have to keep an engagement
at the club.”</p>

<p>“Will you be back to luncheon?” queried Ogden,
accompanying him into the hall.</p>

<p>“No. Please make my apologies to Cousin
Jane,” and Barclay disappeared down the staircase,
while Ogden, with the feeling of work well done,
went back to his den; his hint to Barclay might perhaps
be broader than the situation merited, but it
could do no permanent harm. James Patterson, in
his opinion, was entitled to a fair field, and the
sooner he and Ethel were married the better for all
parties.</p>

<p>Ethel, never dreaming that her cousin concerned
himself in her future welfare, dressed for luncheon
with nervous rapidity. But her haste did not prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
her from stopping now and then to inspect the
ring on her third finger. It was somewhat loose,
and she debated a moment as to whether she should
wind cotton thread about the hoop to tighten it,
but a sudden imperative message from Mrs. Ogden
sent her flying down the hall wearing the ring as
Barclay had given it to her.</p>

<p>She hesitated outside the drawing room entrance,
then with heightened color advanced into the room,
but the man who turned from the window on her entrance
was not Barclay, and the happy sparkle died
from her eyes as she greeted James Patterson.</p>

<p>“I met Mrs. Ogden down town,” he explained,
sitting on the sofa by her. “And she very kindly
brought me home to luncheon.”</p>

<p>“What about your Congressional duties?” asked
Ethel mischievously.</p>

<p class="p2b">“They can go hang,” with impulsive bitterness,
then he added more calmly, “the House has adjourned
over today. I telephoned early this
morning, Ethel, to ask you to go motoring, but the
maid said you were out&mdash;with, I suppose”&mdash;the
bitterness returning to his voice&mdash;“Julian Barclay.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="400" alt="“Come, come, Julian, this won’t do,” he said."
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“Come, come, Julian, this won’t do,” he said.</p>

<p class="p2">Mrs. Ogden’s entrance saved Ethel from reply.
“Come right in to luncheon,” she said. “Professor
Norcross and Walter are already waiting for us,”
and Patterson, disappointed in not having a longer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span><i>tête-a-tête</i> with Ethel, sulkily accompanied them into
the dining room. But Mrs. Ogden saw to it that he
sat between her and Ethel, and he brightened. Only
Professor Norcross, seated across the table, observed
the shadow on Ethel’s face as she glanced at
the empty seat opposite her.</p>

<p>“Where is Julian?” demanded Mrs. Ogden, voicing
Ethel’s unspoken question.</p>

<p>“Lunching at the club! he told me to make his
excuses,” responded Ogden. “Have some wine,
Norcross?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.” The professor smiled at Ethel.
“How went the lesson this morning? Was Takasaki
interesting in his ‘parts of speech’?”</p>

<p>“I do wish, Ethel, you would give up teaching
the Japs,” broke in Patterson, before she could
answer the professor. “I’ve never understood why
you let that little Japanese artist monopolize so
much of your time when you went to the embassy
last winter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Soto!” Ethel smiled at a sudden recollection,
then blushed hotly as she met the professor’s
amused look; Patterson’s jealousy was patent to all.
“I miss Mr. Soto and am so sorry he had to return
to Japan. He was great fun. You should cultivate
a sense of humor, Jim,” with a mischievous
glance at Patterson’s glum countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“I found little amusement in watching Soto making
sketches of you,” he protested. “It was a great
liberty. I am surprised, Ogden, that you permit
Ethel to continue to give lessons to the Japanese.”</p>

<p>“Well, really!” Ethel turned and faced Patterson
indignantly. “I cannot see that it is any concern
of yours.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean it quite in the way it sounds,”
Patterson hastened to explain. He had been in a
temper all the morning, and his disappointment at
not getting Ethel to accompany him motoring had
not added to his amiability. “I do not see why any
patriotic American desires to teach a Japanese English,
and thereby advance the knowledge and
education of our future foes.”</p>

<p>“You are decidedly looking into the future,”
chuckled Ogden.</p>

<p>“Not half as much as the Japs themselves,” retorted
Patterson, happy again in having found his
hobby. “The high cast Japanese as well as the
coolie is not too proud to spy. They are intensely
patriotic; it is the keynote of their character. Tell
me honestly, Ethel,” addressing her directly. “Does
not Takasaki invariably turn your conversations
into questions about our ships, shipyards, and the
personnel of our army and navy?”</p>

<p>“No, not always,” declared Ethel in surprise. “In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>fact, I often allude to them and he changes the
topic. Oh, no, I do not give him information.”</p>

<p>“Not intentionally, no,” agreed Patterson, lowering
his naturally loud voice. “But the Japanese is
ever seeking, always grasping little details, unconsidered
trifles, and from that foundation builds and
reasons in a manner our Occidental mind never
grasps. The Japanese knows more of us today&mdash;our
habits, our weaknesses, our shortcomings&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But not our strength,” broke in Norcross.</p>

<p>“<i>And</i> our strength,” asserted Patterson calmly.
“And he has gained much of that knowledge by aid
of the Japanese employed as servants by ranking
officers in the United States Navy and in the
Army.”</p>

<p>Ogden threw himself back in his chair and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Patterson, you are a worthy
disciple of Carter Calhoun,” he announced.</p>

<p>“A most misjudged man,” retorted Patterson
hotly. “If this country were to listen to him, we
would be in a state of preparedness; instead of
which&mdash;&mdash;” and a gesture of disgust finished the
sentence.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe we are going to the dogs just
yet,” Ogden helped himself to salad. “How about
it, Norcross? Your profession has taken you pretty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>well around the globe; what is your opinion of international
politics?”</p>

<p>Addressed directly, Norcross laid down knife and
fork. “I have talked with a number of Californians,
Mr. Patterson,” he began. “And their
opinion seems to be that the educated Californians
do not fear a Japanese invasion. Of course, as a
representative from that State you are in a better
position to judge of the local situation than I.”</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me,” Mrs. Ogden broke her
long silence, which was commencing to irk her, “how
California dared almost plunge this entire country
into war because she wished to exclude the
Japanese?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a case of dare,” replied Patterson,
“but of foresight. California, by passing the anti-alien
bill, safeguarded the interests of the whole
United States. Secondly the best way to avoid war
is to prepare for it.”</p>

<p>“I do not see any necessity for war with Japan,”
declared Ogden and his positive tone caused Patterson
to flush warmly.</p>

<p>“Nor do we on the Pacific slope see the menace
you in the east imagine approaching on your Atlantic
coast line,” he retorted. “But both are there.
The world could not see the invasion of Belgium&mdash;but
it took place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“But the size of our country, our isolated position,
in themselves preclude the possibility of
invasion,” protested Ethel.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” argued Patterson. “In the
past we have twice been invaded&mdash;in the war of the
Revolution and the War of 1812; and history is
known to repeat itself. Also a nation desiring to
hold its place in the world must not close its eyes to
what is going on outside its boundaries. Building
the Panama Canal has thrown us into world politics.
What we have built we must protect.”</p>

<p>“But I fail to see what Panama has to do with
Japan,” remarked Mrs. Ogden.</p>

<p>“Do with it?” echoed Patterson, his startled expression
bringing a covert smile to Ethel’s lips.
“Why, the canal is the channel for our battleships
to reach the Pacific, and to protect our interests in
the East we must control that ocean. The Japanese
are already in possession of islands lying in our line
of communication with the Philippines. They are
a nation who believe that ‘the Lord helps those who
help themselves.’”</p>

<p>Ethel, finishing her salad, suddenly became aware
that Professor Norcross was closely studying the
ring on her third finger.</p>

<p>As he raised his eyes, their looks crossed, and
Ethel felt her color heighten. But the professor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
glance passed on until it rested on Patterson.</p>

<p>“Dwight Tilghman would have supported your
theories, Mr. Patterson,” he said. “He had, apparently,
a horror of the Japanese.”</p>

<p>“Tilghman! Yes.” Patterson declined the ice
offered him. “Poor fellow! His death was a
frightful shock to me. I had planned to meet him
in Atlanta and missed the train.”</p>

<p>“Was he the man murdered on your train, Professor?”
inquired Mrs. Ogden.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Norcross sipped his black coffee meditatively.
“A very mysterious case. Hasn’t Mr. Barclay
discussed it with you, Miss Ogden?”</p>

<p>“He has spoken of it,” she amended.</p>

<p>“And what is his opinion?” asked Patterson, with
his usual abruptness. “Whom does he think poisoned
Tilghman?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Japanese&mdash;what was his name?”
Ethel looked at Norcross.</p>

<p>“Yoshida Ito,” he responded. “Strange the
police cannot trace the Jap’s whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“They will, they will; give them time.” Ogden
rose at a sign from his wife. “Can I take you anywhere
in my motor, Norcross?” and the professor,
after a lingering, wistful glance at Ethel and Patterson,
who had gravitated again to her side as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>left the dining room, accepted his offer. Mrs. Ogden,
chatting volubly, escorted Patterson and Ethel
back to the drawing room and discreetly disappeared.</p>

<p>“Ethel,” Patterson declined the seat she indicated
and stepped to her side. “Will you marry me?”
and his deep breathing showed the emotion under
which he was laboring.</p>

<p>Ethel turned her head slowly until her eyes met
his. “No, Jim,” she said simply.</p>

<p>Patterson stared at her, his color receding; then
without a word he dropped on the sofa and buried
his face in his hands. Ethel moved to go to him,
then checked herself. What could she say to him?
She would not marry him. Vividly before her rose
Julian Barclay’s face and the memory of his impassioned
whisper as he gave her his ring. Ah, she
must abide by the dictates of her heart; love could
not be forced or manufactured.</p>

<p>“Jim,” she murmured. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Patterson rose at the sound of her voice. “It’s
all right,” he said unsteadily. “You’ve never encouraged
me to hope&mdash;I might have known,” he
sighed wearily. “But it’s human nature to feed on
hope. Tell me, Ethel, is it Julian Barclay?” She
did not need to answer, the light that crept into
her eyes at mention of Barclay’s name betrayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>her. Patterson’s hands clenched spasmodically.</p>

<p>“It’s bitter to lose you,” he acknowledged, and
his tone proved the truth of his words. “But to
Julian Barclay&mdash;a stranger&mdash;where in God’s name
does he come from?”</p>

<p>“Chicago,” Ethel looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“So he says, but I don’t believe it,” Patterson
clutched the back of a chair with hard gripping
fingers. “I don’t believe it,” he reiterated. “I’ve
asked, and no one has heard of him there. I don’t
trust him.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” Ethel’s sympathy was rapidly
changing to anger. “Mr. Barclay is a cousin of our
hostess, Mrs. Ogden.”</p>

<p>“And who was Mrs. Ogden before her
marriage?” Patterson laughed dryly, then noting her
expression he added: “Good God! Ethel, I am
only thinking of you, of your future&mdash;and I don’t
believe Julian Barclay can make you happy.”</p>

<p>“I prefer not to discuss the matter further,”
answered Ethel coldly; then as he winced, she added
impulsively: “Can’t we be friends, Jim?”</p>

<p>He clasped her extended hand eagerly. “Friends,”
he repeated. “Yes, I’ll be your friend; in spite of
yourself, Ethel, you shall be guarded against Julian
Barclay. I’ve seen him somewhere before”&mdash;he
broke off as Ethel tried to withdraw her hand from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>his clasp. “To think I’ve lost you,” he muttered
brokenly. “Ethel, my Ethel,” and drawing her to
him, he kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>“Pardon!” exclaimed an astonished voice behind
them, and Ethel wrenching herself free, darted into
the hall not waiting to see who the newcomer was.
Professor Norcross picked up some papers from the
table, and casting a curious glance at Patterson, who
presented his back to him, retreated to the waiting
automobile.</p>

<p>Safe in her bedroom Ethel flung herself on the
bed and strove to regain her lost composure. She
was furiously angry with James Patterson, more
angry than she had been in years with anyone. It
was horrid of him to have kissed her, she passed
her handkerchief across her lips; it was outrageous
of him to have tried to prejudice her against Julian
Barclay.</p>

<p>Quickly her thoughts turned to Barclay, and she
lay in dreamy contemplation of the events of the
last ten days as they passed in quick succession before
her mind’s eye. Barclay’s personality had
dominated her every action, and all unconsciously
she had fallen under his sway. At first she had
rebelled against her longing to see him, to be near
him; but the eager, wistful lighting of his eyes when
she appeared found a gradual response. His wooing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
had not been of the patient order, and Ethel,
swept off her feet, was drifting with the tide&mdash;to
what&mdash;?</p>

<p>Ethel moved restlessly. Pshaw! James Patterson’s
vague doubts were not worthy a second
thought. Julian Barclay was the soul of honor, of
loyalty&mdash;she would not believe otherwise. But
somehow the bed was no longer comfortable, and
rising Ethel moved over to her bureau; she could
not afford to be idle.</p>

<p>A neat pile of letters, evidently from the afternoon
mail, attracted her attention, and opening
them proved a welcome diversion. The last was a
letter from her mother, and she read the large,
sprawling writing with zest. Mrs. Ogden was a
poor correspondent, and Ethel depended as a rule
on getting news of her family from her father. The
letter was not long; Ethel read with pleasure the
doctor’s favorable report of her father’s condition,
of the few entertainments her mother had attended,
and was about to close the letter when she saw the
initials: “P.S.” and the word “Over” squeezed in
at the bottom of the sheet. Mrs. Ogden, with the
inconsequence which characterized her, was given
to postscripts, which frequently proved the most important
part of her letters, and Ethel turned the
last sheet with eager anticipation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>P.S.&mdash;The enclosed clipping has recalled to my mind a
strange sight which I entirely forgot to mention to your
father. I think I told you of meeting Jim Patterson in the
Atlanta station nearly ten days ago when I went to see Aunt
Susan on her train. The trainmen were very obliging and
I was permitted to escort Aunt Susan to the Pullman car,
owing I suppose to her enfeebled health; sometimes, Ethel,
illness has its perquisites.</p>

<p>Well, to go back. On leaving the Pullman car I got
turned about and walked down the train-shed with the
vaguest idea as to the direction I should take to get back to
the station. On passing a Pullman far down the line, I
looked up and saw through the polished window pane a hand
holding a small open paper between the thumb and first and
second fingers. I perceived nothing but the hand, no head
was visible or other part of the body; but I gathered the
impression that a powder was being shaken into a cup.</p>

<p>There wasn’t a soul in the vicinity, and I walked some
distance before it dawned on me that I was headed the wrong
way, and turned about. I intended speaking of the hand,
but meeting Jim Patterson put the whole thing out of my
mind. I never would have remembered the incident but for
the enclosed clipping. My recollection of the hand, however,
is vivid, and I’ve drawn it on paper for you. Had I better
communicate with the coroner?</p>

<p class="right2">Your devoted</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mamma</span>.</p></div>

<p>Considerably bewildered, Ethel laid down her
mother’s letter and picked up the newspaper clipping.
It proved to be a brief account of the inquest
on Dwight Tilghman, chiefly given over to the medical
testimony. “The deceased came to his death
from a dose of oxalic acid,” Dr. Shively was quoted
as testifying. “This poison was dissolved in brandy,
and must have been administered while Tilghman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>sat in the smoking car in the station at Atlanta.”
The coroner’s next question was also quoted: “Can
you tell us, Doctor, how the poison was added to
the brandy and when?” Shively’s answer followed:
“I cannot. We searched the car, but could find no
trace of either cup, flask, or glass from which Tilghman
must have drunk the poisoned brandy, and no
clew as to the owner of the said cup, flask, or glass
was obtainable.” The newspaper article then ended
with the announcement of the adjournment of the
inquest, the coroner’s statement that the deposition
of Julian Barclay, a fellow traveler, would be read
at the afternoon session.</p>

<p>“Bless me! Perhaps mother has chanced on a
clew,” ejaculated Ethel, unaware that she spoke
aloud. “Julian will be interested in her postscript.
Her ‘hand’ sounds mysterious and terrible; where
is the sketch she spoke of”&mdash;and dropping the newspaper
clipping Ethel hurriedly examined the letter
and its envelope.</p>

<p>Inside the latter she found what she was seeking,
and drew out a piece of drawing paper. Mrs.
Ogden was no mean artist, and on occasions had illustrated
articles for a popular magazine, but her
indolent spirit and inability to concentrate acted as
an effectual check to her ambition, and the one talent
she possessed went neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Ethel inspected the drawing with interest. Mrs.
Ogden had cleverly sketched the outside of a Pullman
car and through the closed glass window stood
out a hand, a large shapely hand, holding a paper
about the size of those enclosing a powder, between
the thumb and first and second finger. The outside
of the hand was nearest the window, and on the
little finger, distinct and clear, was the outline of a
ring. As Ethel bent closer she caught her breath&mdash;slowly,
reluctantly she raised her left hand and laid
it alongside the sketch. In size, design, and color,
the ring on her finger and the ring in the sketch were
identical.</p>

<p>Ethel sat staring at the sketch and at her ring
unmindful of the minutes, and gradually her chaotic
thoughts took form. Dwight Tilghman had
been murdered in Atlanta by a poisoned powder
administered mysteriously; her mother had seen a
hand holding a small paper, which might or might
not have contained a poison powder, in the window
of a Pullman car in the station at Atlanta; and the
hand wore a jade ring with a unique carved gold
setting on its little finger, which Julian Barclay had,
until that noon, worn on his little finger.</p>

<p>Ethel bent over the sketch&mdash;Was it the left hand
or the right which her mother had seen? She could
not tell from the drawing; but it hardly mattered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>Julian Barclay had said he had worn the ring first
on one hand and then on the other, therefore the
point was immaterial. That Julian Barclay was also
a traveler on the train with Dwight Tilghman was
only a coincidence, she assured herself; but was it
also only a coincidence that Julian Barclay had that
morning given her the ring? Good God! Could
he have given her the ring because its possession
to him meant “betrayal and death?”</p>

<p>The sketch fell unheeded to the floor as Ethel
stared in horror at the jade ring with its encircling
dragon.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INTERVIEW</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ulian Barclay’s</span> luncheon at the club had
been a polite fiction, invented under the spur of
his desire to be by himself; he felt that he could not
face Ethel just then; at least, not in the presence
of Walter Ogden and his wife.</p>

<p>Once outside the Ogden house Barclay turned
blindly toward the country. An instinctive desire
to reason his troubles in the open guided his footsteps,
and how long he tramped, and where, on the
outskirts of Washington he never knew, but when
he again reached the down town section of the city
he had recovered his composure and decided on his
future actions. Too long he had drifted with the
tide; whatever the consequences to himself he must
take his place in the affairs of men. As to Ethel&mdash;he
winced and bit his lip; other and better men had
had to renounce their heart’s desire. A past of
shadows was an unstable foundation on which to
build a dream of happiness, and deserved a rude
awakening. There remained but one thing for him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>to do; to bid Ethel good-by and wish her Godspeed
on the road to happiness.</p>

<p>Barclay stepped into a corner drug store, looked
up a number in the city directory, and entering a
taxicab repeated the number to the chauffeur. Within
ten minutes he was standing in an office building
interviewing a colored servant.</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane is in his office now, sir; step this
way, sir,” and the office boy piloted him into a well
lighted room. Barclay sighed impatiently on catching
sight of the rows of people waiting to see the
popular surgeon; then resigning himself to the inevitable,
he took a chair near the window and
awaited his turn.</p>

<p>Barclay picked up a newspaper, but the printed
lines failed to interest him, and when Dr. Leonard
McLane entered the room to summon the next
patient into his consulting office, he was looking out
of the window at the passing vehicles and electric
cars. The surgeon’s roving glance halted as it fell
on Barclay’s fine profile, then passed on, but each
time that McLane reëntered the room he contrived
without attracting Barclay’s attention, to get a better
and nearer view of him.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” McLane’s clear resonant voice broke
in on Barclay’s sad thoughts. “What can I do for
you?” And looking up, Barclay found that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>was the last patient and the two men were alone.</p>

<p>“I would like a word with you in private,” he
said.</p>

<p>McLane bowed. “This way, then,” and stepping
inside the consulting office Barclay selected a chair
farthest from the window, while the surgeon closed
the communicating door, and sat down before his
desk. He waited for Barclay to speak, but it was
some minutes before the latter broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I have not come to consult you as a patient,
Doctor,” he began. “But on a private matter.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” McLane’s voice again aroused Barclay,
and he cleared his throat nervously.</p>

<p>“I realize that you are very busy,” he stammered,
glancing about the well-arranged office. “I promise
not to take up your time needlessly. Here is my
card”&mdash;laying his visiting card on the desk, and McLane
switched on his droplight, for the winter afternoon
was waning into twilight, and read the name
engraved on the card.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Barclay, what can I do for you?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Give me all the details of the inquest on Dwight
Tilghman,” answered Barclay promptly, looking directly
at McLane. “I understand that you went to
Atlanta with the body and stayed on for the inquest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“True, I did,” replied McLane, and imperceptibly
his hand moved the shade of the droplight until
Barclay’s face was no longer in shadow. “Are you
the Julian Barclay whose deposition was read at the
inquest?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“And your reasons for questioning me, Mr. Barclay?”</p>

<p>“I am desirous of helping trace the murderer.”
The surgeon’s question had brought a touch of color
to his white face. “I want to help trap Yoshida
Ito.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you know him to be guilty.”</p>

<p>“No, only believe him to be guilty,” corrected
Barclay quickly. “And all evidence, as far as I can
ascertain, points to him&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Except a possible motive,” supplemented McLane.
“Men do not murder each other, Mr. Barclay,
without a motive.”</p>

<p>The remark brought a curious glint in Barclay’s
eyes which the surgeon observed, but his own expression
remained impassive.</p>

<p>“There is always the alternative of suicide,” remarked
Barclay composedly. “But in the case of
the murder of your cousin, Dwight Tilghman, that
theory can be dispensed with.”</p>

<p>“Your reasons for that assertion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Barclay drew back farther in his chair, and the
movement again brought his face in shadow. “If
Dwight Tilghman had committed suicide the receptacle
out of which he drank the poison would have
been found near him.”</p>

<p>“Then you contend that the absence of such a
receptacle indicates the presence of another person
in the smoking car at the time Tilghman swallowed
the poison?”</p>

<p>“I do. Dr. Shively said the poison was almost
instantaneous in its effect and that it was physically
impossible for Tilghman to dispose of the, eh, cup
or glass, after he had swallowed the poison. Therefore
another person must have been in the car, contrary
to the porter’s testimony, and,” his voice deepening,
“the fact that such a person does not come
forward frankly, as he would do if innocent, presupposes
his guilt.”</p>

<p>McLane nodded his head. “I entirely agree with
your reasoning,” he said gravely. “I asked simply
to see if your view would coincide with mine.
Dwight Tilghman was undoubtedly murdered while
sitting in the smoking car of the Washington, New
Orleans, and San Francisco Express during its stop
at the station in Atlanta, Ga. The autopsy proved
that a dose of oxalic acid had been administered in
brandy, and that he died almost instantly. No other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>cause of death could be ascertained, as Tilghman was
physically well, and there was no indication of
violence.”</p>

<p>“But,” Barclay hesitated and spoke more slowly,
“oxalic acid has a forbidding, sour taste, and for
that reason is seldom used by would-be murderers,
the victim being quick to detect the acid taste. The
medical records prove that it is sometimes mistaken
for Epsom salts and swallowed inadvertently, and
not infrequently used by suicides,” he looked hard
at McLane. “If not taken accidentally, or with
suicidal intent, Tilghman <i>must</i> have detected the
taste of the poison in the brandy.”</p>

<p>“True.” McLane leaned one elbow on his desk
as he bent nearer his companion. “I have already
stated that Tilghman was physically sound, but from
birth he was deficient in one particular&mdash;he had no
sense of taste.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!”</p>

<p>Barclay drew in his breath sharply and stared at
McLane in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Tilghman had no motive to commit suicide,” continued
McLane. “I was made executor of his will,
and his affairs appear to be in excellent shape. While
not wealthy, Tilghman had several thousand dollars
in the bank, besides owning much unencumbered improved
property. He was not married, and I never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>heard of his having a love affair, or a quarrel with
anyone.”</p>

<p>“And yet he died mysteriously,” muttered Barclay.
“Eliminating the theory of suicide and considering
the case as a murder, pure and simple&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s far from simple,” corrected McLane
sharply. “Here we have a man seated in an empty
smoking car poisoned by some unknown person, and
the murder not discovered until five or six hours
later&mdash;no trace of the receptacle in which the poison
was administered, and the passengers on the train
now scattered to the far winds.”</p>

<p>“If the police succeed in finding Yoshida Ito they
need look for no other passenger,” said Barclay
grimly.</p>

<p>“You think so?” and the glance McLane shot at
his companion was keen.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Barclay leaned forward in his earnestness.
“The Japanese on entering the smoking car was attacked
by Tilghman, that I’ll swear to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You mentioned it in your deposition,” put in McLane
dryly.</p>

<p>“Quite so,” composedly. “After the brief scuffle,
during which the Japanese used jiu-jutsu and which,
but for the interference of Dr. Shively and Professor
Norcross, might have had fatal results for Tilghman,
the latter, on recovering his breath, offered the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>Japanese an insult which he was not likely to forgive.
The Japanese mind works quickly, and with
them to plan is to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“It was a subtle brain that planned Tilghman’s
murder,” agreed McLane. “But there are some
points about Ito’s conduct which to me contradict the
evidence.”</p>

<p>“A verdict of guilty was brought against him by
the coroner’s inquest, was it not?” asked Barclay
coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes.” McLane opened a desk drawer and took
from it several papers and newspaper clippings, and
consulted one of them as he continued: “The coroner,
in summing up, asked: ‘On the evidence, are
you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at noon
on the day in question the Japanese, Yoshida Ito,
was in company with the deceased?’ Apparently,”
added McLane, before Barclay could interrupt, “the
jury was satisfied that Ito was in Tilghman’s company,
because a verdict of guilty was brought in.
In other words, the alibi given by Ito could so easily
have been cleverly manufactured that no faith was
placed in it, and it turned the scales against the
Japanese. In reality, they had not one ray of conclusive
proof against him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come!” exclaimed Barclay skeptically.</p>

<p>“I am willing to test my belief,” retorted McLane.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>“Take the alibi&mdash;it required a knowledge beforehand
of the differences in central and eastern time
to think up such an alibi; a knowledge that Atlanta
goes by central time and the railroad trains running
north from there use eastern time. It appears to
me extremely doubtful if the Japanese, clever as his
race is, could have worked out the alibi in so short
a time. He was a stranger in a strange land.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” retorted Barclay. “As
far as we know he may have been there a dozen
times, and while, as I saw stated in an account of
the inquest, it could not be proved that he had ever
been in Atlanta before, he boarded the train at Mobile,
and in that city, which also uses central time,
he may have learned that while central time prevails
in Atlanta, on northbound trains it <i>there</i> changes to
eastern time.”</p>

<p>“That is possible,” McLane laid down the papers.
“The conductor testified that while Ito was dining,
he searched his luggage and found no trace of any
flask filled with brandy, or a cup or glass.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, he could have thrown away all such
incriminating articles by that time,” retorted Barclay.
“Did the conductor search Ito before he left
the train?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately he did not,” replied McLane as
he picked up a southern time-table from among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>papers he had just laid down, and turned to a well-thumbed
page. “Ito boarded the train at twenty-two
minutes of two Wednesday morning, central
time, when everyone was asleep, and his train was
due at Spartanburg at six-twenty that evening, eastern
time. As a matter of fact&mdash;what time did your
train get there?” he broke off to ask.</p>

<p>“We were about two hours late.”</p>

<p>“I see,” McLane again consulted the time-table.
“Your train reached Atlanta at ten minutes of twelve,
central time; now, Mr. Barclay, how long a time
elapsed between Tilghman’s scuffle with the Jap and
your arrival at Atlanta?”</p>

<p>Barclay thoughtfully considered the question before
replying. “I should judge about thirty-five minutes,”
he said finally.</p>

<p>McLane’s hand descended on the desk with a resounding
whack.</p>

<p>“Tilghman’s murder was not planned in any thirty-five
minutes,” he announced. “Every detail gives
the lie to such a supposition. Nor was it done on
the impulse of the moment; and in my opinion the
insult offered the Japanese was not of a nature to
instigate him to commit murder. Wait, Tilghman
said that he mistook Ito for a negro&mdash;pshaw! the
yellow races don’t worry themselves about shade differences
in their complexions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“You are wrong there,” answered Barclay.
“Pride of birth, ancestor worship dominates the high
cast Japanese, and Yoshida Ito, though he desired
us to believe him a traveling salesman, belonged to
the former class. Tilghman’s insult would be keenly
felt and instantly resented by a highborn Japanese.”</p>

<p>“If he was highborn, as you believe, Mr. Barclay,
he would not then have stooped to murder,” argued
McLane. “They kill in fair fight.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Barclay scrutinized McLane for a second
in silence, then pulled his chair closer. “I agree
with you, doctor, in believing that Tilghman’s insult
was not the entire motive for his murder&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then what was?” rapped out McLane.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Barclay moved impatiently. “Let
me explain&mdash;before leaving Tilghman in the smoker
at Atlanta, I, at his request, loaned him my flask.”
McLane regarded his companion with lively interest
as he continued somewhat slowly. “The flask contained
brandy, and I never thought of it again until
I returned to the smoker after helping Norcross
carry Tilghman’s body into a stateroom. I searched
the smoker but could not find my flask. Just afterward
Dr. Shively came back and stated that Tilghman
had been poisoned by a dose of oxalic acid dissolved
in brandy.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell him of having loaned your flask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>to Tilghman?” asked McLane, never taking his eyes
from his companion.</p>

<p>“No,” Barclay smiled ruefully. “I realize now I
should have done so at once, but I was shaken by
Tilghman’s murder, and later&mdash;” he halted uncertainly.
“Well, later, to be frank, I was afraid, not
having spoken of the flask in the first place, I would
not be believed.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see,” McLane frowned. “You were
not in the smoker when Tilghman was killed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no,” the rapid denial was followed by
a short silence which Barclay broke with an effort.
“At the request of Dr. Shively I watched Ito and
accompanied him into dinner. While waiting for it
to be served, the Japanese drew the chrysanthemum
design, which is etched on my silver flask, on the
table cloth.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Barclay could not complain of lack of
attention, for McLane never removed his gaze from
him, and the short ejaculation escaped him unconsciously.</p>

<p>“Ito denied all knowledge of my flask,” continued
Barclay. “He stated that he was a designer, and
that was all I could get out of him.”</p>

<p>“And is that the last you have heard of your
flask?”</p>

<p>“No. On the night of my arrival in Washington
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>I accompanied my cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Walter
Ogden”&mdash;McLane moved suddenly, but Barclay was
intent on his story and did not observe him closely&mdash;“to
the Japanese Embassy. There I thought I saw
Yoshida Ito, and walked down a hall hoping to
come up with him, and entered a room opening from
it. I did not find Ito in the room, but my silver
flask, or its duplicate, was lying on the desk.”</p>

<p>“What did you do then?” questioned McLane.</p>

<p>“Pocketed the flask,” briefly. “And the next day
had its contents tested by a chemist.”</p>

<p>“With what result?”</p>

<p>“A blank&mdash;it contained <i>saki</i>, the national drink
of Japan.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eonard McLane</span>, tilted back in his revolving
chair, regarded Julian Barclay in silence for
several seconds before speaking.</p>

<p>“Have you the flask with you?” he asked.</p>

<p>For answer Barclay drew it from his pocket and
laid it on the desk. McLane bent eagerly over
the flask and examined it with special care. The
silver filigree work over the glass flask was made
into a chrysanthemum pattern, while the lower half
was a solid silver cup, the workmanship of the
latter also carrying out the chrysanthemum pattern.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful design,” said McLane at last.
“And unique in having the flowers on the cup fit
into the filigree work.” He picked it up and turned
the stopper and sniffed at its contents, then replaced
the stopper and removed the silver cup from the
glass bottom. “You are sure your flask was not out
of your possession while on the train before you lent
it to Tilghman?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely positive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Then, conceding that Tilghman was drinking out
of your flask when poisoned, the powder must have
been slipped into this silver cup&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how without Tilghman’s knowledge?” demanded
Barclay.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” admitted McLane. “But I hope
to find out,” he shot a glance at his companion, but
Barclay again sat half in shadow and he could not
see his expression distinctly. “Has it occurred to
you to ask the jewelers in town about the flask?”</p>

<p>“It has; but their information was almost nil,” responded
Barclay. “They declared the flask was
probably manufactured abroad, the workmanship
pointed to that, but it bears no silversmith’s name
or mark. They also said that while the design was
unusual, there might have been a number of duplicates
made from the original.”</p>

<p>“That is not very helpful,” mused McLane.
“Where did you buy your flask?”</p>

<p>“At a little Mexican town, Tia Juana, about
twenty-five miles over the border from Coronado,
Cal. Tia Juana, or ‘Aunt Jane,’ as it is known over
the border, is a great gambling town, where cutthroats,
thugs, and criminals of every class fleeing
from justice, take refuge. In a saloon there I saw
this flask lying on the counter and bought it from
the proprietor. He told me that it had been left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>by a Japanese in payment of a debt, and when Ito
drew the design of the flask on the tablecloth in the
diner on the train, I jumped to the conclusion that
he was the Jap who had sold it to the saloon proprietor,
and taking the reputation of the town into
consideration, I imagined he might even then have
been fleeing from justice.”</p>

<p>“That is not conclusive reasoning,” smiled McLane.
“You were in ‘Aunt Jane’ as a tourist”&mdash;he
paused slightly. “It is equally possible the Jap was
also a tourist and ran short of funds.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Barclay glanced at the clock on
the surgeon’s desk. “And it is over four years
since I purchased the flask.”</p>

<p>“Have you”&mdash;McLane handed the flask back to
Barclay&mdash;“have you made any inquiries about this
flask at the Japanese Embassy?”</p>

<p>“I went to the embassy, but found the ambassador
away on a trip through the Middle West, and the
embassy staff denied all knowledge of the flask. I
am afraid I am taking up too much of your time,”
he added, rising.</p>

<p>“No, no, sit down,” McLane raised a protesting
hand, and Barclay resumed his seat. “I am glad to
talk over Tilghman’s mysterious death with you, Mr.
Barclay. Now, let me understand your theory of
his murder&mdash;you believe that Ito, the Jap, having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>some ulterior motive, followed my cousin on his trip
east, murdered him, and slipped away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is about my idea,” admitted Barclay.
“Take the flask it is a reasonable supposition that,
not finding it in the smoking car near where Tilghman
sat, or among his effects, the murderer removed
my flask. He would not have taken it away if the
flask had not been incriminating; therefore, I believe
the oxalic acid was introduced into my flask.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” agreed McLane. “But we
have yet to discover how it was introduced into the
brandy without Tilghman’s knowledge&mdash;and until
then we have no real proof against anyone.”</p>

<p>“I cannot agree with you,” replied Barclay obstinately.
“I know the flask was originally owned
by a Jap; I meet a Jap, who has a scuffle with Tilghman
shortly before he is murdered; and this Jap is
familiar with the chrysanthemum design of my flask,
even to the minutest detail&mdash;why should he think of
that flask at that time unless he had recently seen
it?” finished Barclay triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Memory plays queer tricks,” responded McLane.
“It might be that Ito&mdash;look here,” checking himself.
“If Ito had murdered Tilghman by putting poison
in your flask, the last thing he would do would be to
call attention to the flask&mdash;it would be betraying too
great a familiarity with the crime.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but it is just in those small points that a
criminal betrays himself,” argued Barclay. “Giving
his alibi, which may or may not be false, but which
admits of his having been in the smoking car at the
hour Tilghman was poisoned, Ito leaves the train
at Spartanburg, and the next time I catch a glimpse
of him is in the Japanese Embassy, and a few minutes
later I find a flask resembling mine on a desk
in the embassy. I tell you, Doctor,” emphasizing
his words by striking his hand in his open palm,
“the silver flask and Ito form a connecting link in
the chain of events leading to the murder of Dwight
Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but I cannot see the significance”&mdash;McLane
paused, and Barclay broke in hastily.</p>

<p>“My object in calling, Doctor, was to ascertain
if Tilghman was using his Congressional influence
to the detriment of Japanese interests here and
abroad.”</p>

<p>McLane considered the question. “I now recall
that Tilghman testified against the Japanese before
the California legislature at the time of the passage
of the anti-alien bill. He and Jim Patterson&mdash;Congressman
from California,” he stopped to explain.</p>

<p>“I have met Patterson,” answered Barclay, and
resting his elbow on the desk, shaded his eyes with
his hand. “You were saying&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“That Tilghman and Patterson were much in accord
on the subject and, I believe, carried on quite
a correspondence. Perhaps Patterson can give me
some data which may throw light on Tilghman’s
transactions with the Japanese. I will see him.”
McLane again consulted the newspaper clippings.
“There are several questions I wish to ask you before
you leave,” pulling his chair up to the desk.
“When did you first meet Dwight Tilghman?”</p>

<p>“The night before his murder. I boarded the
train at New Orleans, and going into the smoker
was introduced to him and Professor Norcross by
Dr. Shively. We four played poker until far into
the night.”</p>

<p>“How did Tilghman appear?”</p>

<p>Barclay hesitated. “Never having met him before,
your question is a little difficult to answer. His
manner to me appeared natural, and while he took
little part in the conversation, he was at all times
pleasant and good-natured.”</p>

<p>“Was he winning?”</p>

<p>Barclay laughed shortly. “I believe so; I was the
only heavy loser. We played nearly all night, and
I believe it was Tilghman who made the first move
to break up the game.”</p>

<p>“Did you talk with him next morning?”</p>

<p>“Not for any length of time. I had a short talk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>with him just before the train stopped at the station
in Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“Was it then you gave him your flask?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he asked me for it, said his scuffle with the
Jap had shaken him up and he needed a bracer.”</p>

<p>“Except for that, did his manner indicate excitement&mdash;terror,
for instance?”</p>

<p>“It did not.”</p>

<p>McLane consulted the notes he had scribbled on
a sheet before him, then asked, “You spoke of Dr.
Shively having introduced you to Tilghman; where
had you known Shively?”</p>

<p>“I met him in Panama and we made the trip to
the States together. He had known Professor Norcross
and Tilghman before, and they both appeared
glad to see him when he joined them in the smoking
car.”</p>

<p>“Had he arranged to meet them on that train?”</p>

<p>“I think not. They all expressed great surprise
at the meeting,” Barclay rose. “I really must be
going, doctor. I cannot take up any more of your
time.”</p>

<p>“Just one more question&mdash;Did you see Shively
while the train was at Atlanta?”</p>

<p>“No,” Barclay paused. “He and Norcross left the
smoking car together just as the train drew into
the station, and that was my last glimpse of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>until they entered the smoker about half an hour
before the dining car steward announced the first
call for dinner.” As he finished speaking Barclay
moved across the room, and the surgeon followed
him.</p>

<p>“I am indebted to you, Mr. Barclay, for coming to
see me,” remarked McLane, opening the private
door leading directly into the outside corridor. “Your
account of Tilghman’s death has interested me, and
I will take steps to investigate the points you have
brought up.”</p>

<p>Barclay pulled his hat down until his features
were partly concealed under the shadow of the brim.</p>

<p>“Will you consult detectives?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The police are already after Ito,” McLane
pressed his thumb on the elevator button. “Several
years ago I was involved in the ‘C. O. D.’ murders,
and in investigating them the detectives did not&mdash;eh,
shine.”</p>

<p>“They are not always infallible,” agreed Barclay,
and McLane’s quick ear detected the faint relief discernible
in his tone. “I will let you know immediately
if I get any information about the flask from
the Japanese ambassador.” The arrival of the elevator
interrupted further conversation, and bidding
McLane good night, Barclay stepped inside the
cage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>McLane continued to stare at the elevator shaft
for some minutes after the elevator with its solitary
passenger had shot downward.</p>

<p>“After fifteen years,” he muttered. “And Jim
Patterson is in town.”</p>

<p>“Not only in town, but here,” announced a voice
just back of him, and McLane, wheeling about, faced
Representative Patterson. “I’ve been waiting in
your front office for the deuce of a long time, McLane,
and hearing your voice in the hall, came out
to intercept you.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have kept you waiting; come back
with me now,” and McLane motioned toward his
private door.</p>

<p>“I won’t stay long,” promised Patterson, preceding
the surgeon into his consulting office, and throwing
himself down in a chair by the desk. “Who was
the man with you in the corridor a moment ago?
His voice sounded familiar, but I only saw his back.”</p>

<p>“A Mr. Barclay,”&mdash;McLane picked up Barclay’s
visiting card. “Julian Barclay.”</p>

<p>Patterson’s expression changed. “Who is he?” he
demanded. “Who is this Barclay?”</p>

<p>McLane’s eyebrows rose in interrogation, but the
glance he shot at the excited man before him was
piercing in its intensity. He tossed the visiting card
to Patterson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Julian Barclay,” he repeated, and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Patterson crumpled the visiting card in his strong
fingers and flung it contemptuously into the waste
paper basket.</p>

<p>“I’m disappointed, McLane; thought you might
give me some information about this Barclay, who
he is, and all that&mdash;I have had some connection”&mdash;he
broke off to stare moodily at the floor. “Barclay
is in love with Ethel Ogden,” he remarked bitterly.</p>

<p>McLane sat erect and stared at him. “And Miss
Ogden?” he asked; and his voice was very grave.</p>

<p>“Has the poor taste to prefer Barclay to me,”
Patterson’s attempt at a smile was ghastly. “Barclay’s
face is familiar, but I cannot place him.”</p>

<p>“Likenesses are very puzzling sometimes,” remarked
McLane. “What is your particular ailment
this afternoon, Patterson? You were as sound as a
dollar the last time I examined you.”</p>

<p>“Still sound, except for the shock of being refused
by Ethel,” Patterson fingered the desk ornaments
nearest him nervously. “It isn’t a thing I’d
mention to anyone but you, McLane.”</p>

<p>“I will not speak of it,” promised McLane. “And&mdash;I’m
sorry, Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old man,” Patterson cleared his voice of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>a troublesome lump. “Before coming here I had a
talk with Ethel’s cousin, Walter Ogden&mdash;he’s not a
bad sort,” he added, and McLane contented himself
with a silent nod of agreement. “Ogden told me
not to take Ethel’s refusal to heart; said she didn’t
know her mind two minutes running.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” the ejaculation escaped McLane involuntarily,
and Patterson glanced at him sharply.</p>

<p>“You know Ethel?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; she is a great friend of my wife, and we
both think her a girl of strong character.” McLane
sorted the papers on his desk methodically and laid
them in a neat pile by his side. “Do not buoy yourself
up with false hope, Patterson; sometimes it is
less pain in the end to face things as they are.”</p>

<p>Patterson frowned. “I don’t think you gave up
the girl of your choice when she was engaged to that
scoundrel, James Donaldson,” he retorted doggedly.
“And I’m not going to give Ethel up to Julian Barclay
without a fight for it. You are sure you have
never heard of Barclay?”</p>

<p>“I have never heard of Barclay before this afternoon,”
answered McLane quietly. “I have just returned
from Atlanta; had to remain there for the inquest
on Dwight Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“So I saw by the newspapers,” Patterson drew out
his cigar case and offered it to the surgeon. “Tilghman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
was a mighty bright fellow, and his murder
a shocking affair&mdash;so unnecessary.”</p>

<p>“I also cannot see a motive for the crime,” replied
McLane gravely. “I cannot believe that the Jap,
Ito, killed him because Tilghman said he mistook
him for a negro.”</p>

<p>Patterson blew a cloud of tobacco smoke into the
air and watched it drift away before answering.</p>

<p>“You Easterners fail to grasp the character of the
Japanese,” he announced. “They are crafty, subtle,
and are past masters in gaining their own way. Silent,
unobtrusive, they live, plan, and accomplish,
while we exist and ignore all signs of danger.”</p>

<p>McLane smiled. “I forgot your hobby for the
moment,” he said. “Perhaps you can tell me if Tilghman
ever aroused their antagonism by any anti-Japanese
demonstration.”</p>

<p>“I believe Tilghman was among the first property
owners to refuse to sell land to a Japanese because
of his nationality,” he answered. “And it brought
out a bitter attack against Tilghman in the press of
Japan.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! What’s a press attack?” and McLane
laughed.</p>

<p>“Little in this country,” agreed Patterson. “But
in Japan, where the press is censored, it is safe to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>bet that the Japanese government approved the attack
upon Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“That would hardly prove a basis for murder,”
mused McLane. “Why was Tilghman coming to
Washington?”</p>

<p>“To visit you and your charming wife.” Patterson
smiled ironically. “You are too modest, McLane;
don’t always look for an ulterior motive when
guests descend on you. I’m sorry if I bore you with
my talk against the Japs; I’m rather full of it this
afternoon, having argued the subject with Professor
Norcross and Walter Ogden.”</p>

<p>“And what views do they hold in the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the customary disbelief.” Patterson moved
restlessly. “I’m surprised at Norcross, he’s broad-minded
and up on affairs generally.”</p>

<p>“Where is Norcross stopping?”</p>

<p>“At the Ogdens’.” Patterson rose. “Are you by
chance going to their dinner tomorrow night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lois told me she had accepted for us.” McLane
followed him into the hall. “Then you don’t
know why Tilghman was coming to Washington, after
first writing me that he couldn’t leave California?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I haven’t the faintest idea.”
Patterson’s impatience was poorly concealed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>“Down,” he roared, and as the elevator stopped, he
called to McLane, “Good night, see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>But once inside his limousine Patterson’s growing
irritability found relief in glaring at his reflection in
the small mirror opposite him.</p>

<p>“What was it McLane was muttering when I
joined him in the hall?” he cogitated. “‘After
fifteen years&mdash;and Jim Patterson in town.’ What
had fifteen years to do with my being in town?”</p>

<p>Fifteen years&mdash;fifteen years&mdash;the words seemed to
his excited imagination to be keeping time with the
twinkling arc lights of the city streets, and Patterson
involuntarily closed his eyes as he reviewed the years.
Suddenly he sat up, his eyes shining, and clutching the
speaking tube, he called to the chauffeur:</p>

<p>“To the nearest telegraph office, quick.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WHISPER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Ogden</span> looked complaisantly about the
theater as the lights were turned up, and a
gentle sigh of content escaped her. No other box
party presented a more distinguished appearance than
hers, and again she heaved a sigh of content; inviting
Ethel Ogden to spend the winter with her had indeed
been a clever inspiration. The girl’s beauty and lovable
character had won her place and popularity in
Washington’s cosmopolitan society, and Mrs. Ogden’s
card tray was the richer by her presence in their
house. Mrs. Ogden was not adverse to receiving the
<i>entrée</i> to exclusive homes by indirect means, if no
better obtained, and she felt that her winter in Washington
had not been misspent energy, and that some
day she might hope to be a Personage.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ogden’s social ambitions had received a
rude setback on being informed that evening by her
husband that Ethel Ogden had refused James Patterson.
Patterson’s great wealth, his career in Congress,
and his family connections made him one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>the few real catches in the National Capital, and
Mrs. Ogden had preened herself on receiving him on
an intimate footing in her house. All her plans had
worked out serenely until Julian Barclay’s arrival,
and at the thought Mrs. Ogden’s face hardened. Inviting
him had not, decidedly not, been an inspiration.
Come to think of it he had more or less invited himself;
if it had not been for a letter from California
stating he was coming east and might stop in Washington,
she would never have written urging him to
visit them. Such being the case, perhaps it would not
be a great breach of hospitality to suggest that he
curtail his visit? Two weeks had slipped by, but she
had mentioned a month! This time Mrs. Ogden’s
sigh was distinctly audible, and brought Barclay’s
wandering attention back to her.</p>

<p>“What is troubling you, Cousin Jane?” he inquired,
replacing a scarf about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“The perversity of human nature,” retorted Mrs.
Ogden, and he laughed, while wondering at the concentration
of her gaze. Mrs. Ogden sighed again;
Barclay was undeniably handsome, but so was James
Patterson in a big, fine way, and she infinitely preferred
the dogged will power and driving force indicated
in his rugged features, to Barclay’s sensitive,
high-strung temperament.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden liked to have good-looking people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>about her, and her gaze rested on her husband and
Professor Norcross with satisfaction; in their way
each was a credit to her box party. Ethel, seated in
the farther corner of the box, was unaware of her
cousin’s scrutiny as she kept up an animated conversation
with Professor Norcross. She had learned
in the hard school of necessity to repress her emotions,
and as she talked on indifferent subjects, the
professor never guessed the effort it cost her, nor
how maddening was the desire to turn and look at
Julian Barclay.</p>

<p>After the first shock of her mother’s postscript,
with its suggestion of crime and treachery, Ethel had
pulled herself together and with the shrewd common
sense of her New England forbears, had reasoned
out her doubts and suspicions. The murder of
Dwight Tilghman, the presence of Julian Barclay on
the same train, the presence of her mother in the
Atlanta station at the time the crime was committed,
the hand at the window grasping a suspicious-looking
paper, the similarity of the ring on the hand in the
window and the one given her by Julian Barclay, the
arrival of her mother’s letter on the day Barclay had
given her the ring, could be&mdash;should be, in her loyal
mind,&mdash;simply coincidences, to be explained away
when she had a talk with Julian Barclay.</p>

<p>She had dressed early and gone downstairs hoping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>for an opportunity to see Barclay alone before dinner,
but he had been the last to appear, and Mrs.
Ogden had hurried them off to the theater immediately
after coffee had been served. On entering the
box she had expected that Barclay would occupy the
seat directly behind her, but on turning around she
found him standing by the chair nearest Mrs. Ogden.
He caught her eye, bowed, and sat down by Mrs.
Ogden.</p>

<p>Ethel had flushed painfully; a look, a smile from
her had always brought him to her side. Could it
be that he was intentionally avoiding her? The
thought stung, and turning her back on Barclay, she
greeted Professor Norcross with so brilliant a smile
that he was conscious of an accelerated pulse. But her
false gaiety had waned with the progress of the
play, and finally she sat silent in her chair and listened
to Norcross, his voice coming to her as from a
long way off.</p>

<p>The amateur performance was given for the benefit
of the Associated Charities, and Washington
society had taken tickets and turned out <i>en masse</i>.
The boxes were filled with members of the Diplomatic
Corps and Cabinet officers, while justices and
men prominent in both Houses of Congress entertained
parties in the orchestra.</p>

<p>“The play is good,” announced Walter Ogden.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>“But the entr’acte are fearfully long. Who is that
bowing to you, Ethel, there, across the further aisle
in the orchestra?”</p>

<p>Ethel looked vainly in the direction he pointed.
“Do you mean Jim Patterson?” she asked, encountering
the Congressman’s eyes.</p>

<p>Patterson rose, excused himself to his neighbors,
and clambering over them, made his way up the aisle.</p>

<p>“No, not Patterson,” explained Ogden. “The
man to his left.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Ethel raised her opera glasses. “Why”&mdash;in
pleased surprise&mdash;“that is little Maru Takasaki
and his wife,” and she bowed in greeting. “Aren’t
they the cutest little pair?”</p>

<p>“If you mean acute, I’ll agree with you.” Barclay
had edged his chair forward and joined in the conversation.
“Takasaki has never taken his eyes off
Patterson during each entr’acte.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me you were observing them pretty
closely to find that out,” remarked Mrs. Ogden dryly.
“Hardly complimentary to me, Julian.”</p>

<p>“I, eh,” he stammered in some confusion, but the
entrance of James Patterson interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Sit here,” exclaimed Ogden rising and pushing
forward a chair toward the middle of the box, and
Patterson, casting an indignant look at Norcross who
still sat by Ethel, accepted the seat offered. Ethel’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>cool smile was not made up to him by Mrs. Ogden’s
cordial welcome.</p>

<p>“What were you discussing when I came in?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“You,” promptly answered Mrs. Ogden, and Patterson
looked gratified. “Julian had just remarked
that the little Jap, Takasaki, has been watching you
all the evening.”</p>

<p>“Not from admiration, I’ll wager.” Patterson’s
smile was grim. “I have a bit of information which
may electrify that heavily armed little empire, and
awaken our national indifference to a coming
crisis.”</p>

<p>“And when will you explode your bomb?” asked
Barclay.</p>

<p>“In a day or so.” Patterson turned and regarded
Barclay attentively from head to foot, and suddenly
he smiled, a smile of such satisfaction that Barclay,
his fingers clenched about his program, had difficulty
in controlling his rising anger.</p>

<p>“Is it to be war with Japan?” asked Ogden, smiling
ironically. “Sorry, Patterson, I don’t scare worth
a cent.”</p>

<p>“I cannot see, Patterson,” Norcross joined in the
conversation, “that we have so very much to fear
in a war with Japan. I think that you overrate their
fighting qualities, and undervalue ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” responded Patterson. “Didn’t
that little empire whip the backbone out of Russia
almost in no time? And we are just as unwieldy and
<i>unready</i> as Russia was in those days.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but was their victory entirely the Japs’ doing?”
asked Norcross. “It is believed in China and
I have heard it whispered in this country that the
crack marksmen of gun crews were enticed away
from American battleships and cruisers in the Pacific
by Japanese wiles to serve on Japanese battleships.
And these American gunners in a large measure
were responsible for Japan’s naval success over
Russia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tush!” ejaculated Ogden unbelievingly.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that tale before,” admitted Patterson,
paying scant attention to Ogden. “And I believe it.
The Japanese use us at every turn, and when the
moment comes, will knife us in the back.”</p>

<p>Ethel had been an interested listener. She had always
looked on Patterson’s fervid tirades against the
Japanese as a distinct bore, but suddenly she saw
her way to eliciting information without appearing
to do so, and promptly took a hand in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me of a Japanese knifing an
American on the train with you, Mr. Barclay?” she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>It was the first time she had addressed him that
evening, and Barclay bent forward so as not to lose
a note of her voice.</p>

<p>“A Japanese did poison Dwight Tilghman, not
knife him,” he answered. “Norcross and I were
passengers on the same train.”</p>

<p>“How horrible!” Ethel shivered. “Could no one
prevent the crime?”</p>

<p>“No one was around&mdash;” Barclay waited until Patterson
stopped speaking across him to Mrs. Ogden,
and then continued. “The crime was apparently
committed while the train was in the station at Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, what a public place in which to commit
murder,” chimed in Mrs. Ogden, not liking to be
left too long out of the conversation. “I should have
thought the murder would have been detected instantly.”</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t.” At that moment the orchestra
ceased playing and in the sudden quiet Barclay’s
voice rang out sharply. “The passengers were
mostly strolling about the station or in Atlanta, during
our enforced wait there, and the Pullman cars
were left empty.”</p>

<p>“Did you go sight-seeing also, Barclay?” and as
Patterson put the question his eyes never left Barclay’s
face. His absorption prevented him observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
Ethel’s eagerness. She held her breath for Barclay’s
answer which was slow in coming.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. Ethel’s taut muscles relaxed
as she sank back in her chair. She had caught the
expression in Barclay’s eyes, and it had given the
lie to his spoken “Yes.” Barclay leaned further
forward and spoke to her directly. “Have you ever
come across a man named Yoshida Ito among your
Japanese friends?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she mumbled, and raised her handkerchief
to conceal her trembling lips.</p>

<p>“Have you ever met a Japanese named Yoshida
Ito?” repeated Norcross, as the orchestra resumed
playing and drowned Barclay’s voice. “He is the
man who is thought to have murdered Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“Yoshida Ito?” Ethel shook her head. “I will
ask the ambassador and Mr. Takasaki; perhaps they
may have heard of him.”</p>

<p>“They probably have,” agreed Patterson. “But
you will get nothing out of those two men but what
they want you to learn. There goes the curtain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ethel never afterward remembered one word of
what transpired on the stage; she was grateful for
the darkness which concealed the agony she was
enduring from too inquiring eyes. With dry lips and
burning eyeballs she sat staring before her, combating
with every reason she could command her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>growing conviction that, if not the actual criminal,
Julian Barclay was, in some way responsible for
Dwight Tilghman’s death. If he had not lied when
asked his whereabouts in Atlanta! There must be
extenuating circumstances&mdash;and yet he had lied. Of
that Ethel was thoroughly convinced; she had come
to know and read Julian Barclay’s expression as only
a loving woman can during their brief, happy days
together.</p>

<p>Under cover of the darkness Barclay edged back
his chair until he could get an uninterrupted view
of Ethel. He could only see the outline of her
shapely head and shoulders, and he longed unspeakably
for the sound of her voice, the touch of her
hand. In a sudden rush of passion all his loss came
home to him, and an involuntary groan escaped between
his clenched teeth. It was drowned in rounds
of applause as the curtain descended at the end of
the play.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Patterson, you must have supper with
us at the New Willard,” announced Mrs. Ogden,
rising to put on her wraps. “I shall not take ‘no’
for an answer.”</p>

<p>“You are awfully kind, Mrs. Ogden.” Patterson
looked appealingly at Ethel, but her face was averted
and he only caught a glimpse of a flushed cheek. He
was about to decline the invitation when his dogged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>perseverance gained the mastery. “I’ll come with
pleasure.”</p>

<p>Barclay moved impulsively to help Ethel on with
her cloak, then drew back as Patterson slipped it
about her shoulders. Bah! it was Patterson’s right,
he was the interloper, and turning, he made blindly
for the stairs. Others were before him, however,
and he made but slow progress. Suddenly he realized
that Ethel was standing at his elbow. He was about
to speak to her when he caught sight of a face in
the crowd beneath them.</p>

<p>“There&mdash;look!” he cried, and his excitement communicated
itself to Ethel.</p>

<p>“Where?” she eagerly scanned the crowd. “Oh,
that’s Mr. Takasaki.” But her words were unheeded
as Barclay, regardless of the crowd about
them, forced his way down the staircase and out of
the theater.</p>

<p>Ethel turned in bewilderment to Professor Norcross
who was on her other side, and to his horror
he found her eyes were filled with tears.</p>

<p>“Pay no attention to Barclay,” he whispered. “He
is excitable&mdash;and tomorrow will be properly
ashamed of his eccentric behavior. Ah, here is Mrs.
Ogden.”</p>

<p>“Ethel,” Mrs. Ogden was out of breath from her
efforts to call to them over the heads of the crowd.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>“Mr. Patterson will take you over to the Willard
in his car.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Ethel shrank back. Her endurance had
reached the breaking point, and she could not face
another interview with James Patterson. “I&mdash;I&mdash;have
a splitting headache, Cousin Jane; could you
let me go directly home?”</p>

<p>“And not go to the Willard!” ejaculated Mrs.
Ogden in consternation. “Why, Ethel, Secretary and
Mrs. Thomas and their guests are to have supper
with us. You simply must come.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you walk over to the Willard with me,”
suggested Norcross. “The air may do you good,
Miss Ogden.” And Ethel flashed him a grateful
smile as she took his arm, but at the theater entrance
Patterson joined them.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you coming with me, Ethel?” he asked.</p>

<p>Norcross answered for her. “Miss Ogden has a
bad headache, and we are walking over to the hotel
in the hopes that the exercise may do her good.”</p>

<p>“But the Willard is several blocks off,” exclaimed
Patterson, aghast. “And in that light dress, Ethel&mdash;better
let me take you both over in my limousine;
I have room for you, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Norcross chose to overlook the incivility
which accompanied the invitation to himself.
“I did not realize that the hotel was so far from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>the theater, Miss Ogden. Suppose we ride over
with Patterson.”</p>

<p>Ethel acquiesced wearily. So long as she did not
have to talk alone to Patterson it was immaterial
to her how she reached the hotel. Except that she
felt under obligation to her cousins she would not
have attended the supper. She was grateful for the
silence of the two men during their short ride to the
hotel, and when she entered Peacock Alley she had
regained control of herself.</p>

<p>It was close on two in the morning when Ethel
reached her bedroom, and without undressing, threw
herself across the bed and closed her eyes. She lay
there an hour or more, inexplicably weary in mind
and body; then dragged herself upright as the clock
on the mantel chimed four. She removed her gown
and slipped on a heavy silk wrapper and made her
way to her desk. There was one thing she must
do before more hours passed, and taking up a pen
she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>:</p></div>

<p>A lengthened pause followed, then she added:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I’ve read your postscript with interest&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>She paused again, and continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I see no connection between the mysterious hand and the
poisoning of Dwight Tilghman. Don’t bother the coroner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>with any wild theories. And I wouldn’t speak of being in
the train-shed without a porter, it might get you into trouble
with the railway officials.</p>

<p>Much love, darling Mother, to you and Dad.</p>

<p class="right2">Your devoted</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>.</p></div>

<p>Taking up an envelope Ethel addressed and sealed
it and searched among her papers for her stamp
book. Finding it at last she placed a special delivery
as well as a two-cent stamp on the letter, and
paused undecidedly. The letter, if left on the table
in the lower hall, would be posted before seven
o’clock by the butler, and she could not rest until
she knew that her warning was on its way to her
mother. She had given orders to have her breakfast
served in her bedroom, and if she kept the
letter it might not get mailed before noon.</p>

<p>Ethel crossed the room and opening her hall door
peered cautiously into the corridor. A solitary electric
light was burning at the head of the staircase,
and Ethel, leaving her bedroom door ajar, stole
along the corridor and down the staircase. She had
reached the table in the large front entrance hall,
had placed her letter upon the silver card tray and
was returning toward the staircase when the sound
of a window being raised sent her heart into her
mouth.</p>

<p>She had paused by an alcove, and as she laid her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>hand on one of the long portières hanging before it,
a figure flitted by her, raced noiselessly to the back
of the hall, raised a window and vaulted through it.
Thoroughly frightened Ethel started forward to ring
the hall bell, but a sound behind her caused her to
retreat hastily into the shelter of the curtained alcove.
Peering cautiously out from behind the portière, she
was thunderstruck at the sight of Julian Barclay.
Whether he came from the library, the drawing
room, or the entrance leading to the servants’ quarters
it was impossible to tell, as he was well in the
hall when she saw him. Had he detected her presence?</p>

<p>Too surprised to call out, Ethel watched him cross
the hall and make for the open window. He looked
out for a second, then drew back and moved swiftly
over to the huge carved mantel. By aid of the hall
light, which Walter Ogden kept burning all night,
Ethel saw that Barclay wore dark trousers and a
dark tightly fitting jersey. Pausing by the mantel
Barclay took from an inside pocket a small object
and, first touching it to his lips, placed it in one of
the Dresden china jars standing on the mantel, then
running back to the window, he vaulted through it.</p>

<p>Completely mystified and not a little terrified,
Ethel paused undecidedly; then her woman’s curiosity
conquered, and she crept softly over to the mantel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>What was it that Barclay had handled so tenderly?
She slipped her hand inside the jar and taking out a
small package wrapped in chamois, unrolled it. It
was a miniature of herself.</p>

<p>For one moment Ethel stared at it with unbelieving
eyes, then, her face suffused with blushes, she
started to return the miniature to its hiding place
inside the jar when she became conscious that someone
was watching her from the staircase. Wheeling
about she saw Professor Norcross, a sweater drawn
over his hastily donned trousers, and caught the
glint of light on the revolver in his hand. Seeing
she had observed him, he raised his finger to his lips,
and crossing the hall, joined her.</p>

<p>“Did he go that way?” he whispered, indicating
the open window.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Ethel slipped the miniature unseen inside
her pocket.</p>

<p>The professor, not waiting for her answer, hurried
to the window. A second more and Ethel was
by his side, peering eagerly out into the night. It
was a fair drop to the ground below, but near at
hand was the low roof of the garage. Ethel, wondering
if Barclay and the man he pursued had used
that means to reach the yard, looked farther down
the yard to where the alley light cast some illumination,
and her heart beat fast at sight of Julian Barclay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
sitting astride the brick wall. The watchers
saw him lean downward toward the alley side, and a
faint whisper reached them.</p>

<p>“Ito, I tell you I have no more money to spare.”</p>

<p>How many minutes Ethel stood by the window
she never knew, but a strong hand drew her back
across the hall and inside the portières of the alcove
as a noise of someone scrambling upward cut the
stillness. A few seconds later Julian Barclay
clambered through the window, turned, closed it, and
sped swiftly up the staircase.</p>

<p>In silence Ethel walked over to the staircase, Norcross
at her side, but under the full rays from the
electric light on the newel post she recoiled at the
expression in the professor’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You must not tell,” she whispered, putting out
her hand imploringly. “You must not get Julian into
trouble. He”&mdash;her voice shook&mdash;“he can explain.”</p>

<p>Norcross laid a soothing hand on her shoulder.
“Trust me,” he whispered comfortingly. “Good
night,” and with a sobbing word of thanks, Ethel fled
upstairs.</p>

<span class="smaller">QUICKSAND</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Ogden</span> was bored, and when bored her
temper was apt to prove uncertain. Only
Professor Norcross and her husband had appeared
for breakfast, and the latter had persisted in discussing
politics and the money market, two things
which she abhorred, and she had seen them depart
with a sense of relief. She had left the dining room
shortly after to interview the florist’s assistant, who
had come to decorate the house for her dinner that
evening.</p>

<p>The interview was longer than she anticipated,
and several times she called upon Julian Barclay,
who had entered the reception hall while the discussion
was still going on, to settle knotty points in the
arrangement of palms and flowers.</p>

<p>“Do sit down, Julian,” Mrs. Ogden switched her
comfortable arm chair back from the table. “You
have been prancing up and down this hall until my
nerves are quite on edge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Cousin Jane,” exclaimed Barclay
contritely. “I wasn’t aware that my restlessness
bothered you.” He stopped before the carved
mantel-piece. “I thought you had two Dresden jars
on either side of the clock,” he remarked, raising
the piece of china in his hand and glancing critically
inside it.</p>

<p>“So I had, but that lazy, worthless parlor maid
broke it when dusting this morning.”</p>

<p>“Broke it!” gasped Barclay, and the jar he held
almost slipped from his grasp.</p>

<p>“Take care,” Mrs. Ogden jumped. “Do put down
that jar, Julian; I cannot afford to lose both,” she
entreated. “Yes, the maid broke the other, and
had the audacity to say that it was cracked in the
first place.” Mrs. Ogden sniffed. “I let her know
I thought she was cracked.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” murmured Barclay, looking regretfully
at the jar, and not hearing her last remark.
“It’s a shame to lose the pair. Perhaps I can cement
the pieces together for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could you?” Mrs. Ogden spoke more hopefully.
“I had them all collected and placed in this
box.”</p>

<p>“Let me see them,” Barclay came over to the
table and opening the box, spread the broken china
before him; the smallest piece did not escape his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>scrutiny. “Are these all?” and Mrs. Ogden actually
started at the sharpness of his tone.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Don’t they fit?”</p>

<p>“The big pieces do,” assembling them together as
he spoke. “Was there, by chance, anything in the
jar?”</p>

<p>“Anything in the jar?” repeated Mrs. Ogden.
“No. Nothing was ever kept in either of them. Do
stop fingering those pieces, Julian, you may cut your
hand on the sharp edges.”</p>

<p>“No danger.” Barclay thoughtfully returned the
china to the box. “I shall have to ask the maid if
she picked up all the pieces.”</p>

<p>“You can’t do that because she has gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” staring blankly at his cousin.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” tartly. “You don’t think I’m going
to keep a bull-in-the-china-shop in my employ do you,
with all my valuable bric-a-brac? No, indeed; I gave
her a week’s wages and sent her packing.”</p>

<p>Barclay replaced the cover on the box before
speaking again.</p>

<p>“I can’t blame you for firing her,” he said.
“There’s nothing more aggravating than losing an
article you value&mdash;through carelessness&mdash;cursed carelessness,”
he added with suppressed bitterness, and
Mrs. Ogden stared at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“It’s good of you, Julian, to take so much interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
in my jar,” she said, much pleased. “And sometime
when you are not busy, if you will stick the jar
together....”</p>

<p>“Surely, surely,” he broke in. “Could you give
me the girl’s full name and address, Cousin Jane,
she....”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me she has stolen something from
you,” exclaimed Mrs. Ogden, interrupting in her
turn.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Barclay moved restlessly. “Quite the
contrary, she laundered some handkerchiefs for me,
and I’d like to send her a tip.”</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of you,” commented Mrs. Ogden
dryly. “She can take that tip out in my broken jar.
Rose was a better laundress than a parlor maid, although
Mrs. Leonard McLane gave her an excellent
reference. Don’t you want any breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Breakfast? Have you had yours?”</p>

<p>“Ages ago,” and her tone implied the feeling of
virtuous satisfaction which accompanies early rising.
“Run along into the dining room, Julian; you must
be starved. Why, it’s nearly ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hungry,” protested Barclay, turning nevertheless
toward the entrance to the dining room.
“Coming this way, Cousin Jane?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going upstairs,” and gathering her belongings
together Mrs. Ogden departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Barclay found the dining room deserted, and halfheartedly
ate the tempting dishes set before him.
Inquiry from the butler had elicited the news that
Walter Ogden and Professor Norcross had breakfasted
and gone down town some time before.</p>

<p>“Has Miss Ogden been down?” he finally asked
the butler, who hovered behind his chair.</p>

<p>“No, sor, she is after breakfastin’ in her room.
Another muffin, sor?” holding the bread plate coaxingly
before him. Barclay was a favorite with the
servants.</p>

<p>“No more, thanks.” Barclay pushed back his
plate. “Has Rose, the parlor maid, left the house
yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sor. I saw her go over an hour ago, sor.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me her full name and address?”</p>

<p>“Rose O’Day, sor. She wint direct to the station,
sor, an’ I understood her to say she was goin’ to her
home in New York, but I dunno her exact address.
I’ll ax the cook, sor, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” and Barclay, picking up the morning
paper left by Ogden, listlessly read its contents.
Charles was back in a short time.</p>

<p>“She lives somewhere in Cohoes, near Troy, New
York, sor; but the cook doesn’t know her house address.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Barclay, concealing his disappointment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>slipped a tip in Charles’ ready hand. “Is luncheon
to be at the usual hour?”</p>

<p>“Half an hour earlier, sor.” Charles started to
clear the table as Barclay rose. “Mrs. Ogden has
engaged extra help for the dinner tonight, and I
have to show them the silver and things, sor.”</p>

<p>“I hope the new servants all come highly recommended,”
remarked Barclay, with sarcastic emphasis
which the man servant never saw. “Mrs. Ogden’s
handsome silver and jewels would be a temptation,
a grave temptation, to thieves.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sor.” The butler looked considerably
startled. “The extra footmen come from the caterer,
sor. Will you take the paper, sor?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ve read it,” and stuffing his hands in his
pockets Barclay left the room. In the hall he went
direct to the mantel and stared dully at the remaining
Dresden jar. Inwardly he anathematized the
absent-mindedness which had cost him the loss of his
most precious possession.</p>

<p>Had Rose, the parlor maid, seen Ethel’s miniature
before she broke the china jar, and stolen it, or had
the miniature also been destroyed in the fall? The
latter hardly seemed likely, for he had found no
trace of broken glass or ivory among the china. She
might have accidently broken the miniature and
stolen the gold case, but even then there would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>been some ivory or glass picked up in the <i>débris</i>.
Barclay sighed heavily. Undoubtedly the girl had
stolen the miniature, for what reason he could not
imagine, and his best plan was to go to Cohoes and
try and find her.</p>

<p>On his way to his bedroom Barclay paused in
front of Walter Ogden’s den and listened. Had
Ethel taken up her customary post in the den? The
tinkle of the telephone bell sounded behind the
closed door, and he heard her voice answering the
call. A great yearning to see her swept over him,
and he raised his hand to knock at the closed door,
but the muscles contracted at a sudden thought, and
his knuckles touched the mahogany so lightly that
no sound followed the contact. With a gesture of
despair he continued his way down the corridor.</p>

<p>Barclay’s presence outside the door had not gone
undetected. Ethel, one hand resting on the desk,
waited breathlessly as his familiar footsteps sounded
down the corridor and stopped before the den.
Would he come in? Her sad eyes brightened at the
thought. Instinctively she answered the telephone’s
abrupt summons, and as she received the Central’s
apologetic: “Wrong number, excuse me, please,” she
heard Barclay’s receding footsteps and turned
wearily back to her work.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on her attention wandered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>and throwing down her pen in despair, she took from
the top drawer of her typewriting desk a small object,
and removing the chamois, looked at her miniature.</p>

<p>All through the sleepless night, when her tired
brain refused to refute or accept the evidence of
Julian Barclay’s complicity in the poisoning of
Dwight Tilghman, and agonizing sobs shook her, the
touch of the miniature under her pillow had brought
a ray of comfort. Julian Barclay had treasured her
miniature, had kissed it&mdash;Ethel had slipped the miniature
out of its chamois covering, and fallen into
fitful slumber holding it against her white cheek.</p>

<p>Ethel took a magnifying glass out of her drawer
and examined the miniature. It was an exquisite
piece of workmanship, and the likeness extraordinary.
Her wonder grew. She had known Julian
Barclay a little over two weeks; it hardly seemed
possible that the miniature could have been painted
and framed in that time. She studied the gold case
with interest, but it bore no name or initials, and
turning it this way and that, she attempted to open
it. Finally convinced that it was tightly soldered in
place, she laid the miniature down and toyed with
her pencil in deep thought.</p>

<p>If, as she imagined, Julian Barclay had left the
miniature in the jar that it might not be broken in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>his window climbing, why had he not stopped on
his return and looked for it in the jar? Instead, he
had gone immediately upstairs. Could it be that he
had seen her and Professor Norcross and dared not
loiter in the hall?</p>

<p>The idea brought a lump to Ethel’s throat. If so, it
was but one more evidence of his guilt. That he was
guilty there would be no doubt&mdash;his own words to
Ito at their clandestine meeting proved a secret understanding
and bribery. Ito, a fugitive from justice,
would not have risked exposure by entering the
Ogden residence unless the matter had been one of
desperate importance. Probably her appearance
downstairs had frightened him away, and Julian Barclay,
not having seen the cause of his flight, had
gone in pursuit to tell the Japanese&mdash;what?&mdash;that
“he had no more money to spare.” The inference
was all too plain.</p>

<p>With slow, unwilling fingers, Ethel summed up
the evidence against Julian Barclay on the paper pad
before her. He was a passenger on the train with
Dwight Tilghman; he was the last person known to
have seen Dwight Tilghman alive; he had lied when
stating that he had been sight-seeing about Atlanta at
the time the crime was committed. A hand wearing a
jade ring, the duplicate of one he had since given
her, had been seen by her mother through a Pullman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
car window holding a paper, which by its size
and shape might easily have contained a powdered
poison, at an angle which suggested the act of pouring
something into a cup; and if that was not enough,
only a few short hours before, she, Ethel, and Professor
Norcross had seen him meet Yoshida Ito, the
supposed murderer, clandestinely, and his words:
“No <i>more</i> money to spare,” implied that he had
furnished the Japanese with sums in the past. Hush
money!</p>

<p>Ethel, through a blur of tears, stared before her,
then in a sudden revulsion of feeling, she tore the
paper on which she had been writing into tiny bits.
Where she had given her love she had given her
loyalty. Evidence might be against Julian Barclay,
but a motive for the crime was missing.</p>

<p>Dashing the tears from her eyes, she again examined
the miniature by aid of the magnifying glass.
Suddenly her conversation with Barclay at the Japanese
Embassy reception flashed into her mind; had
that inspired him to have her miniature painted?
She knew of no one else who would have gone to
the expense, except possibly James Patterson, and
she felt confident that he would not have done it
without first speaking to her. No, Julian Barclay
must have had the painting executed, the act itself
fitted in with his romantic, quixotic courtship of her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>There only remained the question of time&mdash;could the
miniature have been painted in the short time she
had known him?</p>

<p>Carrying the miniature over to the light Ethel almost
stared her painted prototype out of countenance;
then wrinkled her forehead in a puzzled frown.
She had discovered another startling fact&mdash;every detail
of the gown she was wearing in the miniature
was unfamiliar; she had never owned or worn one
like it!</p>

<p>A loud knock at the door awoke her from her
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Luncheon is served, Miss Ethel,” announced
Charles, opening the door in response to her call.</p>

<p>“I’ll be right down; tell Mrs. Ogden not to wait
for me,” and as she spoke, Ethel replaced the
chamois about the miniature and laid it in her desk
drawer, alongside Julian Barclay’s jade ring. Pausing
only long enough to arrange her curly hair and
pinch some color in her cheeks she hastened down
to the dining room.</p>

<p>“Just a light lunch, Ethel,” said Mrs. Ogden, as
Professor Norcross rose and pulled back her chair.
“Walter telephoned he would not be back from the
Capitol, and Julian hasn’t shown up.”</p>

<p>“He’s comin’ now, Mrs. Ogden,” volunteered the
butler, and Barclay appeared a second later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Barclay’s words of apology were addressed to
Mrs. Ogden, but his eyes sought Ethel as a needle
seeks its magnet. The dining room was not well
lighted, and he failed to catch her expression as she
returned his greeting, but under cover of Mrs. Ogden’s
incessant talk his glance stole again and again
to the silent girl on his right. Mrs. Ogden at last
awoke to the increasing darkness as wind clouds obscured
the sunshine, and directed Charles to switch
on the electric lights, to Barclay’s secret satisfaction.
He never wearied of looking at Ethel.</p>

<p>“By the way, Julian, why did you disappear so
mysteriously last night?” inquired Mrs. Ogden.
“You did not come to my supper party.”</p>

<p>“I owe you a thousand apologies,” exclaimed Barclay
flushing. “I confess I never gave it a thought,
Cousin Jane,” and at sight of her offended look, he
added hastily, “I hope that you will pardon my absent-mindedness
when I tell you that among the
crowd leaving the theater I saw Yoshida Ito.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Mrs. Ogden. “Oh, now I
recollect; the Jap who poisoned Dwight Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And wishing to hand him over to the
police, I gave chase.”</p>

<p>“And did you catch him?” demanded his cousin
breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“No, worse luck! He eluded me in the crowd
and disappeared in the direction of the Mall.”</p>

<p>“Did you find any further trace of the Jap?” inquired
Ethel, breaking her long silence, and her voice
sounded unnatural in her own ears.</p>

<p>“No.” Barclay moved a tall glass compote containing
nuts, so that he could look directly at her.
“No. I wandered about that part of the city, questioned
the policemen on duty there, and came home.
Do you know, Cousin Jane,” helping himself to a
walnut, “that you had a burglar here last night?”</p>

<p>“What!” Mrs. Ogden’s fork fell with a clatter
into her plate, and her usually rosy cheeks turned
pale.</p>

<p>“Fact.” Barclay’s serene smile widened at seeing
the concentrated attention which Ethel and Professor
Norcross were giving him. “I suppose my sudden
and unexpected glimpse of the Jap, Ito, excited me,
for I could not sleep and sat up reading. I thought
I heard a window open, and stole downstairs just
in time to see a man vault through the hall window.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! We might all have been murdered
in our beds!” Mrs. Ogden turned a stricken
face to the agitated butler. “Any silver missing,
Charles?”</p>

<p>“No, madam, not a piece; I’ve just been after
acountin’ of it,” he stammered. “I locked up the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>house as usual, last night, madam, but this mornin’
I did find the pantry window unlocked.”</p>

<p>“Probably that girl, Rose, was a confederate,”
Mrs. Ogden shuddered at the thought. “That was
why she was so agitated this morning. I’ll notify
the police. Could you identify the burglar, Julian?”</p>

<p>Barclay cracked a nut before answering.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t see very well in the half light,” he
said. “But do you know, the man, in size and quickness,
reminded me of the Jap, Ito&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ethel and Norcross exchanged glances across the
table.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you see the intruder face to face?” asked
Norcross, breaking the pause.</p>

<p>“No, I did not catch up with him,” answered Barclay
lightly, and only Ethel’s look of agony stayed
the rejoinder on Norcross’ lips.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE QUARREL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>rofessor Norcross</span> laid aside the late
edition of the <i>Times</i>, and took, with a word of
thanks, the three-cornered note handed him by Mrs.
Ogden’s maid. But on closing the door of his bedroom
he lost no time in unfolding the note paper,
and read the words with eagerness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Professor</span>:</p>

<p>I <i>must</i> have a word with you before the other guests arrive.
I will be in the library at seven-thirty. <i>Please</i> be there.</p>

<p class="right3">In haste,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ethel Ogden</span>.</p></div>

<p>Norcross laid the note on his bureau and consulted
his watch; then rushing to his closet dragged out his
evening clothes, and commenced dressing with feverish
haste.</p>

<p>But with all his speed the professor, twenty minutes
later, paused on the landing of the staircase and
an exclamation of pleased surprise escaped him. The
florist had transformed the stately entrance hall and
rooms beyond into fairyland. Tall, graceful palms,
plants, and clusters of cut flowers filled every nook
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>and cranny, while the system of indirect lighting suggested
earlier in the day by Julian Barclay, added to
the beauty of the scene. However beautiful the
scene, it had only power to hold Professor Norcross
for a moment, and he lost no further time in reaching
the library. Ethel was there before him.</p>

<p>“It is good of you to come to me,” she exclaimed,
impulsively extending her hand, and Norcross clasped
it in both of his.</p>

<p>“Are you not feverish?” he asked, alarmed at the
hotness of her hand and her flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” indifferently. “Professor, tell me”&mdash;she
stopped and continued more slowly. “What is
your opinion of Julian Barclay?” Norcross hesitated,
and she added proudly, “I desire the truth.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Norcross looked at her compassionately.
“On first meeting Julian Barclay I thought
him a pleasant, agreeable companion,”&mdash;he was picking
his words with care. “A man who might have
achieved considerable success in whatever he undertook,
had not a comfortable income deprived him of
the necessity and spur to apply himself to work.”</p>

<p>“And you think now&mdash;?” suggested Ethel, as he
paused.</p>

<p>“Too much idleness is the curse of many American
men,” he said. “If they cannot find a proper
outlet for their energies, and there comes a time when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>idleness palls, they are apt to turn to unwise occupations
and corrupt associates. Such, I fear, is the case
with Julian Barclay.”</p>

<p>Ethel covered her eyes as if to shut out the glare
of the droplight electric lamp by which they were
sitting, and Norcross reaching over, switched it off.
In the light thrown out by the open fire on the hearth
he could see Ethel fairly distinctly, and he frowned
as he detected the effect of her sleepless night. The
light and shadow of the room, the high-backed
brocaded chair in which she sat, her perfectly fitted,
simple evening gown, made a quaint picture, and
Norcross’ bottled-up indignation found vent in a
muttered curse. It seemed criminal that a man of
Julian Barclay’s caliber should have it within his
power to cause her suffering.</p>

<p>Ethel, suddenly conscious of the silence, dropped
her hand from before her eyes, and glanced at Norcross.
She found his pleasant face set in grim lines.</p>

<p>“Go on,” she begged. “You were saying&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Idleness, money, no home ties, and the Far East
are a bad combination,” he responded gravely. “Barclay
seldom speaks of the years he has spent in the
Orient; in fact, he leads one to infer that he knows
little about it. That first prejudiced me against him,
for I had heard&mdash;” he did not finish his sentence.</p>

<p>“You had heard”&mdash;prompted Ethel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“I had a letter from Dr. Shively recently, calling
my attention to the fact that Barclay, in his deposition
to the coroner here and read at the inquest on
Tilghman in Atlanta, omitted all mention of his
whereabouts at the time Tilghman was poisoned. As
every passenger even remotely connected with the
affair, proved his alibi, Barclay’s omission was
surprising.”</p>

<p>“But he said last night that he was sight-seeing,”
interposed Ethel, in a vain endeavor to combat what
reason told her was the truth.</p>

<p>“Neither Shively or I caught a glimpse of him
about the station,” said Norcross gravely. “And
Shively writes that he has questioned many of the
passengers, porters, and railroad officials at Atlanta
and all state they did not see a man answering his
description. Until Shively’s letter arrived, I have
thought the Jap, Ito, guilty, but now after last night”&mdash;he
paused and contemplated her thoughtfully. “I
am forced to believe that Julian Barclay must be
involved in the crime also.”</p>

<p>Ethel shaded her face with her hand. “Your reasons?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“We both saw him talking to Ito last night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barclay admitted at luncheon that he had
found Ito here,” Ethel was dogged in her determination
to exonerate Barclay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“True; but when I asked him if he had not come
face to face with the Jap, he denied it, and you and
I saw him talking with the Jap, and his words: ‘Ito,
I have no more money to spare,’ bear but one interpretation.”
Norcross laid his hand on hers. “Miss
Ogden, I am hurting you cruelly&mdash;it grieves me to inflict
pain.”</p>

<p>Ethel smiled bravely, but as she met the sympathy
in his kind eyes, her own brimmed over. She dashed
the tears impatiently away. “It is better that I face
the situation,” she said. “Why did Julian bring up
the subject of the burglar at luncheon, why mention
the Jap at all?”</p>

<p>“Because,” Norcross lowered his voice. “I believe
he knew we were watching him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Ethel’s thoughts flew to her miniature;
Barclay had not stopped to get it on returning from
the interview with the Jap, and he had not inquired
for it since. He must have seen her that night and
supposed she had taken it.</p>

<p>“Barclay was clever enough to take the bull by the
horns,” added Norcross. “He forestalled all questions
by announcing that <i>he</i> was chasing a burglar,
a meritorious act. To others it will be a perfectly
valid excuse for his appearance in the hall at that
hour; but, unfortunately for him, we looked out of
the window.” Norcross moved his chair closer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>“Had you seen Barclay before luncheon?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Nor had I,” thoughtfully. “Then he chose the
first opportunity to tell us in each other’s presence,
of his pursuit of the so-called burglar.”</p>

<p>Ethel contemplated Norcross in despair; he was
weaving a web about Barclay which even her loyalty
could not ignore.</p>

<p>“Had Mr. Barclay known Dwight Tilghman for
a long time?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No. I believe they met for the first time the
night before Tilghman’s death.”</p>

<p>Ethel brightened. “Then, if they were virtually
strangers, there could be no motive for the crime.”</p>

<p>Norcross did not answer at once, and when he
finally spoke it was with reluctance. “We played
poker that night on the train, and Dwight Tilghman
won a large sum of money from Barclay, and yet
when Tilghman’s personal belongings and baggage
were examined after his death, the money was missing.”</p>

<p>Vaguely Ethel grasped his meaning. “No, I don’t
believe it,” she cried. “It was no sordid crime, and
if that is the only motive imputed to Julian for the
murder of Tilghman, I’ll not believe him guilty.”</p>

<p>Norcross moved uncomfortably. “I hope that
time will prove you right,” he said. “It may be that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>Barclay knew this Ito in the Orient, and the Jap is
blackmailing him for some past indiscretion, which
has nothing to do with Tilghman’s death.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right!” Ethel drew a long
breath, hope had returned to her. She sprang to
her feet. “How can I thank you?”</p>

<p>“By getting back your old, gay smile,” he exclaimed
coloring, and speaking lightly to conceal his emotion.
“There, that’s better,” as Ethel flashed him a grateful
look and a smile. “I hope you will always come
to me to solve your problems.”</p>

<p>“I will, I will,” she promised fervently. “I want
to speak to you about a&mdash;” the entrance of Walter
Ogden interrupted her.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking all over for you, Norcross,”
he said, not seeing Ethel, who had retired to one of
the windows as he came in the doorway. “Jane
wants you in the dining room; something is wrong
with the decorations, and she thinks you can advise
her.”</p>

<p>“Surely, I will come at once. Will you excuse me,
Miss Ogden?” bowing toward Ethel, and Ogden
wheeled about.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you were downstairs, Ethel,” he
exclaimed. “Coming with us?” holding back the
portières as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Not just this minute,” Ethel stepped inside one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>of the deep window recesses. “I want to cool off.”</p>

<p>“Cool off?” Ogden’s voice expressed his astonishment.
“All right,” and he followed Professor Norcross
with somewhat mixed feelings. Had he interrupted
a flirtation? A flirtation with the professor&mdash;Ogden
had some difficulty suppressing a chuckle.</p>

<p>Ethel had spoken on the impulse of the moment.
She wanted to be by herself; Norcross had given her
food for thought. Blackmail, ah, that would explain
Barclay’s surprising interview with the Jap.
What more likely than that Ito, a fugitive from
justice, had applied to Barclay for funds with which
to escape from the country? He probably had bled
Barclay before. As for the indiscretion&mdash;if Barclay
had remained any time in the East, he might have
become involved in some political entanglement.</p>

<p>Pulling the catch of the leaded glass window,
which opened inward, Ethel peeped outside. The
cold air was refreshing, and she filled her lungs with
it.</p>

<p>A wide balcony ran by the window, and leaning
farther out, Ethel was startled at seeing a man
standing at the end overlooking the street. He
moved slightly and by the light shining through the
drawing room windows Ethel recognized Barclay.
Quickly she drew back into the library and closed
the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Barclay might have heard the faint noise the window
catch made falling into place, but his attention
was centered on James Patterson who stood at the
corner just under the arc light talking to a man. They
were too far away for Barclay to distinguish a word
of their conversation, but that it was animated Patterson’s
gestures indicated. At last Patterson moved
toward the Ogden residence, and his companion lifted
his hat in farewell, and the arc light fell full upon
Yoshida Ito.</p>

<p>Dumbfounded, Barclay continued to stare at the
little Japanese, and before he had collected his wits,
Ito had disappeared. He was not so much surprised
at the Jap’s unexpected appearance, but to find him
in Patterson’s company took his breath away. He
had gone out on the balcony to smoke a cigarette uninterrupted,
but when he reëntered the drawing room
through the long French window, his cigarette was
still unlighted.</p>

<p>Barclay found the drawing room deserted, and he
was about to go into the library when the entrance
of James Patterson stopped him. The two men
stared at each other for a prolonged moment.</p>

<p>“This is better luck than I expected,” said Patterson.
“I have wanted to see you alone for some
time.”</p>

<p>“Your ambition might have been attained before,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>if you had let me know you wished to see me,” replied
Barclay sarcastically, and Patterson stiffened.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” he rejoined swiftly.
“Your manner has led me to believe that you desire
to avoid me&mdash;as in the station at Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“You flatter yourself,” Barclay laughed easily,
then his voice deepened. “Now, sir, that you do
see me, what do you wish?”</p>

<p>“That you leave town at once.”</p>

<p>“Anything more?”</p>

<p>“That you have nothing further to do with Ethel
Ogden.”</p>

<p>Barclay’s hitherto suppressed anger rose to boiling
heat. “On what grounds do you make that request?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“As her affianced husband,” with calm effrontery.</p>

<p>Barclay flinched. “But that Mr. Ogden gave me
to understand that you and Miss Ogden are engaged,
I would decline to believe your assertion.”</p>

<p>“By&mdash;” Patterson in a towering rage stepped toward
him, but Barclay stood his ground, and he
stopped. “I will give you twelve hours to leave
Washington, or I will expose you,” he announced.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Thanks,” dryly. “I had planned to leave tomorrow,
but now&mdash;I’ll stay here.”</p>

title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“I will give you twelve hours to leave Washington or I will<br />
expose you,” he announced.</p>

<p class="p2">Patterson’s smile was far from pleasant. “Bravado
will not help you,” he snarled, raising his voice. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>shall go the limit to protect Miss Ogden and Washington
society from the attention of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Miss Ogden can take care of herself,” announced
a clear voice behind them and the two men swung
about and confronted Ethel.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to leave, Ethel,” broke in Patterson
hastily, before Barclay could speak.</p>

<p>“I will not,” and she stepped nearer. “I have
only just come in. What were you quarreling about,
Mr. Barclay.”</p>

<p>“A matter of no moment,” he answered. “A&mdash;a
political discussion.”</p>

<p>Ethel looked at him closely. “Thank you,” she
murmured, and her warm, bright smile almost broke
down his composure.</p>

<p>Ethel’s manner to Barclay had not been lost on
Patterson, and it fanned his jealousy to a white heat.</p>

<p>“Let’s have done with lies,” he began roughly.
“This man is not a fit associate for you, Ethel.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Ethel laid a restraining hand on Barclay’s
arm as he stepped toward Patterson, and he
thrilled at her touch. Ethel faced Patterson. “I
will have you understand, James Patterson, that I
choose my own friends, and I consider Mr. Barclay
worthy of my friendship.”</p>

<p>Impulsively Barclay raised the little hand on his
arm and kissed it passionately.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>
<p>“God bless you!” he murmured, and she crimsoned
as the whisper reached her.</p>

<p>“Ethel, Ethel,” Patterson threw out his hand beseechingly.
“You are totally ignorant of Barclay’s
true character. No, you’ve got to listen to me,” as
she drew back. “Or if not to me”&mdash;catching sight
of Dr. Leonard McLane, who had just stepped inside
the drawing room&mdash;“then you must hear Dr.
McLane. McLane, who is this man?” pointing to
Barclay, who had grown deadly white. Only Ethel
heard Barclay’s sharply drawn breath as he stood
tranquilly waiting.</p>

<p>McLane advanced, bowed to Ethel, and then
paused in front of the group.</p>

<p>“Barclay, is it not?” he asked courteously, and
held out his hand.</p>

<span class="smaller">A STARTLING INTERRUPTION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>alter Ogden’s</span> glance roved around the
dinner table as he kept up a brisk conversation
with his right hand neighbor, and a sense of
triumph replaced his concealed anxiety. The dinner
was unquestionably a success, in point of service,
decorations, appointments, and the social standing of
the guests. Ogden’s contact with the world had
taught him not only the value of money, but when
to spend it with the best results. He practiced his
creed, “dollar diplomacy,” at home as well as abroad.
His wife’s success deserved reward, he mentally decided,
and picked out a diamond-studded wrist watch
at which Mrs. Ogden had cast longing eyes when in
the jeweler’s two days before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden, seated between a South American
ambassador and a high dignitary of the church who
had recently come to Washington, helped herself to
the salad with a distinct feeling of elation. The
dinner had moved smoothly, no lull in the conversation,
no <i>contretemps</i> such as anxious hostesses feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>even to their finger tips, had marred the pleasure of
the evening. And it had not opened auspiciously.
On returning from the dining room with Professor
Norcross after rearranging the decorations, she had
found Lois McLane standing in the hall, and together
they had walked into the drawing room and
into a tableau. No other word in Mrs. Ogden’s
vocabulary fitted the situation. Patterson’s ill-suppressed
fury; Ethel’s flushed cheeks; Dr. McLane’s
suave manner, and Barclay’s sparkling eyes and air
of elation, all indicated a scene. What it was about
she had no idea, for they had talked inanities, all,
that is, except, Barclay, who had excused himself and
left the room. Mrs. Ogden had heartily wished it
was the house&mdash;she was commencing to regard her
handsome cousin as her Frankenstein monster, and
everything transpiring out of the ordinary she attributed
to his disquieting influence. He was actually
making her nervous. She had seen to it that the
width of the table separated him from Ethel, and but
for the presence of Maru Takasaki, would have assigned
James Patterson to take Ethel out to dinner.
But Ethel was most decidedly the proper person to
entertain the Japanese attaché, and Ogden had assured
her that Representative Patterson and Takasaki
and his wife must be put as far apart as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>Discovering that the ambassador was deep in conversation
with the woman seated on his right, Mrs.
Ogden turned to the churchman who was her left-hand
neighbor.</p>

<p>“I am admiring your beautiful china and glass,”
he said, finishing his salad with due enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Mrs. Ogden smiled delightfully.
She greatly respected the bishop, and his benign manner
had a soothing influence on her volatile nature
which was restful as well as comforting. “I am glad
you like it. This is my first winter in Washington&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” interposed the bishop, smiling. “We
are both in a sense missionaries&mdash;you have come to
Washington to teach society how to live&mdash;while I
have come to teach it how to die.”</p>

<p>A low laugh from Ethel, who had overheard his
comment, caused the bishop to turn from his flurried
hostess. “And what is Miss Ogden doing?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Teaching also,” she answered.</p>

<p>“The heathen?” and the bishop’s smile was infectious.</p>

<p>“Foreign diplomats,” Ethel looked demurely at
her plate. “And Mr. Takasaki is so ungrateful that
he is urging me to give up lessons and try writing.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and so increase your sphere of teaching?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>The bishop was enjoying himself. “Why not try
your hand at writing a tract which would be a ‘best
seller’? <i>That</i> would be a greater achievement than
writing a popular novel.”</p>

<p>“And require greater genius,” laughed Ethel. Her
old buoyant spirit had returned since the scene in the
drawing room. Her faith in Julian Barclay was not
misplaced; his behavior in the face of James Patterson’s
charges had proved that. And Patterson’s
attack upon his character had not been backed up
by Leonard McLane, as he had evidently expected
and counted upon. And vindicated in one instance,
Barclay would be also cleared of any implication in
the murder of Dwight Tilghman, so ran Ethel’s subconscious
thoughts, and her heart was filled with a
great thanksgiving. Even unemotional Takasaki
met her gay smile with a show of responsiveness, and
the bishop had eaten his dinner with greater relish
for the added spice of her merry mood.</p>

<p>“Genius is so misdirected these days,” sighed the
bishop. “And few writers make the distinction between
strength and coarseness. You can congratulate
yourself, Mr. Takasaki,” as the Japanese attaché
turned to join in their conversation, “that the
problem novel has not struck Japan.”</p>

<p>Takasaki, when in doubt, always smiled, and the
bishop envied him his strong white teeth. “Sanètomo
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>Ito is our great national political writer,” he said.
“He solves all what you call problems on paper.”</p>

<p>“I forgot your problems are mainly political,” responded
the bishop, concealing a smile. “Ours, alas,
embrace the home. What did you say, Mrs. Ogden?”
and the bishop turned and gave his full attention to
his hostess.</p>

<p>“Sanètomo Ito,” Ethel repeated the name thoughtfully.
“Is he known in this country, Mr. Takasaki?”</p>

<p>“His writing have been given in English, and I
believe are read by the most studious,” replied the
Japanese. “And he travel here once or twice.”</p>

<p>“Has this Mr. Ito any relatives in the United
States?” asked Ethel.</p>

<p>Takasaki considered the question before replying.
“Many Itos in Nippon, Mees Ogden; and one most
high admiral; but I no keep track of family member.
You met a Nipponese name Ito?” and Ethel
became conscious that his black eyes were boring into
her with the intentness of his gaze.</p>

<p>“I have not met him, only seen him,” she corrected.
“Yoshida Ito.”</p>

<p>The Japanese attaché shook his head. “I know
Itos, but no Yoshida. You think my wife look
well?” and by his manner Ethel knew that the topic
of Yoshida Ito was to be taboo between them. She
had tried too often to make Japanese discuss matters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>which they wished avoided, not to know the futility
of such proceedings, and she accepted the change of
conversation with good grace.</p>

<p>To James Patterson the dinner appeared never
ending. He was furiously angry with Julian Barclay
and Leonard McLane; but for the latter’s
extraordinary conduct in the drawing room Julian
Barclay would have been exposed and sent about his
business. He could not conceive what had induced
McLane to shield Barclay&mdash;he did McLane the
justice to admit that money considerations would not
influence him. Perhaps after all he was wrong, and
Julian Barclay was the man he pretended to be. Patterson
looked at Barclay, who sat on his side of the
round table; no, he must be right, he could almost
swear to his identity&mdash;but McLane? Patterson
shook his head in bewilderment. There was nothing
for it but to await the answer to his telegram.</p>

<p>“A penny for your thoughts?” said a soft voice at
his side, and facing about Patterson smiled at Lois
McLane, a happy edition of the Lois Tremaine
whose troubled courtship had carried her along the
path of crime safely to the altar with the man she
worshiped.</p>

<p>“Can you not guess my thoughts?” asked Patterson.</p>

<p>“Well, judging by your glances, I imagine you are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>wishing you were seated by Ethel Ogden in place of
the Japanese,” and Lois laughed mischievously. “It’s
not very complimentary to me, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There are extenuating circumstances,” completed
Patterson, reddening. He had not realized that his
absorption in Ethel was observed by others, and as
he seldom took teasing in good part, he hastened to
change the conversation. “I cannot cure the Ogdens
of inviting Japanese to their house; some day these
Japs will bite the hand that feeds them.”</p>

<p>“Did I not see an item in yesterday’s paper that
Japan would shortly vacate Kiao-Chau, which they
took from the Germans?” asked Lois, striving to get
away from personalities.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is published periodically,” Patterson
crumbled his cracker with impatient fingers.
“Japan cares very little to colonize in China; her
people cannot compete with other Orientals; here
they can live on a few grains of rice a day, while our
laborers require a full dinner pail. They will work
all day without complaint, and will underbid any
laborer in the land.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they seek new lands to conquer?”</p>

<p>“Because the Japanese are not pioneers; their
method is to colonize in cultivated land, to insidiously
work their way to the top, and to control the local
government,” retorted Patterson. “They are doing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>that daily in Mexico, buying concessions, here, there,
and everywhere. It was owing to their influence
that our troops were attacked at Carrizal.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Lois looked her surprise, but before she
could continue Patterson’s attention was claimed by
the woman on his left, and she sat silent, not wishing
to break into the discussion which Julian Barclay,
on her right, was having with his dinner partner.
Lois had not met Barclay before, having accompanied
her husband to Atlanta, but what she had
heard of him had awakened her interest. She was
often guided by first impressions, and she was still
debating in her mind whether she liked Barclay or
not, when he turned and looked at her.</p>

<p>“Be a good Samaritan, Mrs. McLane,” he said,
“and tell me who is sitting next each other on the
other side of this centerpiece.”</p>

<p>“I can see only one corner of the table,” Lois
craned her head and looked around the bed of roses
which formed the centerpiece. “Ethel Ogden is sitting
between the bishop, and Mr. Takasaki. Ethel
is lovely tonight”&mdash;in a burst of enthusiasm. “If I
were a man I’d be mad about her.”</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to disagree with your opinion.”
Barclay laughed but the look in his eyes won
Lois’ sympathy. “I think Miss Ogden&mdash;perfection.
Have you known her long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we were chums at boarding school. I am
devoted to the whole family. Unfortunately, their
income has been curtailed of late years, and Ethel
insists on being independent, and as you probably
know, gives English lessons and does secretary
work.”</p>

<p>“It is greatly to her credit,” agreed Barclay
warmly. “In all my travels, Mrs. McLane, I have
yet to find a race whose women compare to ours.”</p>

<p>“If such are your sentiments”&mdash;Patterson broke
rudely into the conversation, and for the first time
since their interview in the drawing room, addressed
Barclay directly. “Why have you expatriated yourself?”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken. I never renounce what I admire
and love,” answered Barclay curtly, and turned
back to his dinner partner.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, which Lois made no attempt
to break, and Patterson, too angry to speak,
emptied his champagne glass.</p>

<p>“Ogden has an excellent wine cellar,” he commented,
putting down his glass. “Ever heard how
he made his money?”</p>

<p>“No, except that Ethel once said he held heavy
interests in the Pacific shipping trade with the Far
East.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Most of the carrying trade between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>the Pacific Coast and the Orient has been transferred
to Japanese steamship lines,” remarked Patterson
thoughtfully. “I’m afraid he’ll find he has made a
poor investment, unless&mdash;Ever been to Guam?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is a delightful naval station.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, also one of our most strategic points,
and not far away, commanding the entrance of
Guam, is Jaluit Island, of the Marshall group, which
was seized by the Japanese from the Germans. It
is strongly fortified, another Gibraltar in fact,” Patterson
spoke with growing earnestness. “If we have
interests in the Far East, it is time to take steps to
safeguard them, or they will vanish in a night.”</p>

<p>“I do recall that when we stopped at Hawaii I
was struck by the hundreds of Japanese in Honolulu
and its vicinity,” said Lois. “Did I not hear that
the Japanese had also taken the Caroline Islands
near the Philippines, from the Germans?”</p>

<p>“They have,” grimly.</p>

<p>“But what can the Japs really do to us?” questioned
Lois. “They could not hope to conquer this
great nation.”</p>

<p>“Their hopes, so far, only include dominion over
the Pacific Ocean, and to get that they must fight us.
Alaska, with its still unexplored and undeveloped
wealth, the Philippines, our trade with China, all
will be jeopardized,” Patterson declined more wine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>“And Japan’s latest diplomatic move, her treaty with
Russia, is giving grave concern to European nations.”</p>

<p>“But Russia has always been our friend,” objected
Lois. “She would not befriend Japan against us.”</p>

<p>“We have not one treaty with Russia today,” Patterson
spoke impressively. “Japan and Russia hope
to work their will in China unmolested.”</p>

<p>“You are too pessimistic,” chided Lois.</p>

<p>“No. Americans jeer and laugh at the idea of
war with Japan; so did England and France receive
the idea of another great European war&mdash;and war
came, engineered by mighty Germany. The same
spirit of German militarism is abroad in Japan today&mdash;and
the American nation will only recognize
it when all our lines of communication to the Pacific
are cut, and the fight is on.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Lois laid a cautioning hand on his sleeve.
“Not so loud, Mr. Patterson, the ambassador is
listening, and both Mr. and Mrs. Takasaki understand
English.”</p>

<p>“People always stop talking at a dinner at the
wrong moment,” grunted Patterson, however lowering
his voice. “What is it, Charles?” as the butler
stopped at his side.</p>

<p>“A letter for you, sor; came special, sor,” and
the butler laid a square envelope at his plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“Will you pardon me, Mrs. McLane,” Patterson
took up the envelope and slit the flap with his fruit
knife. “I asked my secretary to send on anything
important, as I am expecting”&mdash;as he spoke he jerked
at the contents of the envelope, which gave all at
once and a photograph, face up, shot into Lois’ lap.
Finding but a slippery resting place on her silk gown,
it would have continued its flight to the floor, but
Barclay’s hand retrieved it.</p>

<p>“Yours?” he asked, handing the photograph to
her, and Lois was conscious that his voice sounded
strained.</p>

<p>“No, it belongs to Mr. Patterson.” Lois turned
to hand it to its owner, and was startled by his expression.
Patterson took the photograph mechanically.</p>

<p>“Smell anything?” he demanded, and Lois drew
in a long breath.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” she ejaculated. “It is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>Wheeling spasmodically about, Julian Barclay
caught a glimpse of Yoshida Ito’s yellow face peering
out from inside the portières, and again the cry rang
out:</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FATAL REQUEST</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was a breathless pause as host and
guests alike sat stupefied. In the pantry
frightened servants echoed the cry of “Fire,” while
from outside came the hoarse shouts of men, the
clang of fire bells, the rush and roar of the arriving
engines. Swiftly the spell in the dining room was
broken, and bounding to their feet men and women
crowded about Ogden.</p>

<p>“Who closed these folding doors?” stormed Ogden,
tearing apart the portières and tugging at the
doors concealed behind them. “My God!” He fell
back as a volume of smoke drifted through the hall
door thrown open by one of the guests. The electric
lights in the hall beyond resembled glow worms in
the smoky atmosphere, and the men hesitated for a
second.</p>

<p>“The smoke is coming downward,” cried Barclay.
“The fire must be upstairs,” and darting across
the broad hall he made for the front door, on which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>blows resounded, and tore it open. In raced firemen,
axes and chemical apparatus in hand.</p>

<p>“Fire’s on the second floor,” shouted the foremost
fireman. “Get everyone out on the sidewalk,” catching
sight of the frightened women streaming into the
hall.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop for your wraps,” warned Patterson,
grasping Mrs. Ogden and Ethel, and hurrying them
out of doors. McLane, one hand on Lois, and the
other steering little Madame Takasaki, was at their
heels. Professor Norcross followed with the
bishop’s wife, while the bishop, no show of haste in
his calm demeanor, assisted the ambassador’s wife
and two other guests to pilot their way down the
front steps. Takasaki, seeing his wife and the other
women were safely in the street, turned back and
stood with Walter Ogden in the hall.</p>

<p>Outside the house ladders had been placed and a
stream of water turned on the windows through
which flames were bursting.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Oh! Oh!” Mrs. Ogden clutched Ethel. “I do
believe the fire’s in the den.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_182.jpg" width="400" alt="“Go back, Ethel,” Patterson commanded. “The fire is

title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">“Go back, Ethel,” Patterson commanded. “The fire is<br />
spreading and you may be injured.”</p>

<p class="p2">“The den!” Ethel studied the position of the
flaming windows, and in the glare recognized the outlines
of familiar furniture inside the burning room.
With a smothered exclamation she started toward
the front door, but at the bottom step Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>Norcross laid a detaining hand on her scarf, which
floated loose as she continued upward. James Patterson
caught up to her in the hall.</p>

<p>“Go back, Ethel,” he commanded. “The fire is
spreading and you may be injured.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” she panted. “Let go, Jim. There is
something I must get out of the top drawer of my
typewriting desk; it stands by the door leading into
Walter Ogden’s bedroom. The fire is in the other
part of the room&mdash;I can reach my desk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go for you,” noting her agonized expression.
“What is it you want out of your desk?”</p>

<p>“My miniature and a ring”&mdash;she blurted out, and
would have followed Patterson, but a strong hand
pushed her back from the staircase.</p>

<p>“Please leave, lady,” exclaimed one of the firemen,
and Ethel turning reluctantly, protestingly
away, saw Patterson bounding up the staircase. A
second more and he was lost to sight in the dense
smoke.</p>

<p>On the third floor Julian Barclay hurried swiftly
from room to room peering into closets, under beds,
then upward, through the servants’ quarters, to the
attic, but his search was unavailing. Yoshida Ito
had vanished into thin air. Reluctantly he gave up
his search, and paused on the landing of the third
floor stairs to glance out of the window. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>lurid glare of firelight he made out the group of
shivering women standing well back in the crowd
which grows, Aladdin-like, at the cry of “Fire.”
From the dense volume of smoke rolling through
the hall beneath, and the added glare in the street,
he judged the firemen had not gained control as
quickly as he had imagined they would when first
starting on his search for the Japanese.</p>

<p>Barclay continued his way down the staircase
with added haste; he had no desire to be caught in a
fire trap. The dense smoke ahead drifted aside for
a moment, and he caught sight of a man advancing
half-crouching near the still lighted electric hall lamp.
Barclay crooked his finger on the trigger of his revolver
and measured the distance.</p>

<p>Outside in the street the imperative clang, clang
of the gong on a speeding automobile scattered the
ever increasing crowd. The fire chief had arrived.
His appearance in the house was hailed by the crack
of a shot, followed by another and another. The
firemen in the second story gave back. Bullets were
whistling uncomfortably near.</p>

<p>“Good God!” Walter Ogden, upstairs with the
firemen, turned a ghastly face to the shadowy form
nearest him. “The boxes of cartridges which I kept
in my desk have ignited.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden, shivering partly from cold and partly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>from shock and excitement, stood with her guests,
begging each fireman who approached within hailing
distance, to get her guests’ wraps from the cloak
room, and finally the bishop and the ambassador
brought out a heap of costly cloaks and coats and
passed them indiscriminately among the women who
were only too thankful to cover their bare shoulders
and hide their handsome jewelry from the curious
glances of the crowd.</p>

<p>Firemen had gained admission to the house next
door to the Ogdens’ and from windows overlooking
the fire, poured a stream of water into the burning
rooms, for the fire had spread to Mrs. Ogden’s bedroom.
Bullets zipping by their ears, caused the firemen
to drop their hose in consternation, and the men
on the ladders likewise ducked out of range.</p>

<p>“Are we to burn up entirely?” groaned Mrs. Ogden.
“My beautiful things. Oh, oh, what’s that!”
and she clutched Ethel despairingly. “Are they
shooting each other in the house?”</p>

<p>Ethel listened to the fusillade in horrified silence,
while straining her eyes to catch a glimpse of James
Patterson among the men clustered in the Ogdens’
entrance hall. He had had plenty of time to secure
her miniature and ring and return. Fear chilled her
at the thought that he might have been overcome
by the smoke. Why, why had she let him go? She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>should have recollected that her desk was of metal
and supposedly fireproof. Mrs. Ogden’s grasp on
her arm tightened, and Ethel turned to remonstrate,
but she found her cousin in no condition to listen
to reason or release her clasp.</p>

<p>“Ethel, do tell me what is going on?” she implored
distractedly. “There, listen!”</p>

<p>“It sounds like cartridges exploding,” gasped
Ethel.</p>

<p>“Cartridges?” Mrs. Ogden forgot everything in
sudden fury. “Walter left two boxes of them in his
desk&mdash;oh, the rascal&mdash;the fool!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” Professor Norcross shook her roughly.
“I came out to tell you, Mrs. Ogden, that the fire
is almost under control, and as soon as the cartridges
are all discharged the firemen will get into the room.
There, they are resuming work now.”</p>

<p>The professor proved a true prophet. With the
arrival of another engine and the additional force
of water, the firemen stamped out the last spark of
fire. Mrs. Ogden and her guests again gathered in
her drawing room, and the crowded street was once
more empty, the spectators drifting away in the
wake of the departing firemen, a few of whom remained
behind.</p>

<p>The rooms and corridors of the house were still
filled with smoke, when Leonard McLane, his eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>smarting, stopped to fling open first one window and
then another as he made his way through the house.
Turning from the back stairs into the front corridor
on the second floor he stopped abruptly at sight of
Julian Barclay bending over a figure stretched on
the floor.</p>

<p>Barclay lifted a relieved face as McLane touched
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I’ve just found James Patterson,” he said. “I
fear he is overcome by the smoke,” rising to make
place for the surgeon. “Is the fire out?”</p>

<p>McLane did not answer at once; his skillful fingers
making swift examination, and his expression grew
grimmer and more grim.</p>

<p>“The fire is out,” he announced, in answer to Barclay’s
repeated question, and slipping one hand under
the recumbent man turned him over. “And Jim Patterson
is dead,” he added, pointing to a small hole
through which blood was ebbing slowly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Midnight was long past when Julian Barclay
reached his bedroom. He carefully locked the door
behind him and drew down the blinds to his windows,
then stopped before his mirror, but a glimpse of his
face caused him to draw back and glance over his
shoulder. Pshaw! the occurrences of the night were
getting on his nerves. Other men had looked white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>and weary; Ethel, even, had fainted away at news
of James Patterson’s tragic death, and Walter Ogden
had groaned in bitter horror at the havoc wrought
by his careless keeping of the cartridges in his den.</p>

<p>Before undressing Barclay took from his trousers’
pocket a small chamois-covered miniature and uncovering
it, gazed long and thoughtfully at the
painted likeness of Ethel Ogden. Suddenly, with a
gesture almost of horror, he laid the portrait on the
dressing table, and again inserting his hand in his
pocket, drew out a crumpled piece of cardboard and
applied a match to it. The match caught, and the
cardboard twisted and turned like some living thing
writhing in pain, disclosing amidst the flames the
lower half of a torn photograph.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> the sound of advancing footsteps Mrs. Ogden
dropped her newspaper with a faint
scream. Her nervous system had not recovered
from the shock of the night before&mdash;fire and death
had robbed her of her customary air of repose.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, my dear,” she exclaimed in a relieved
tone, as Lois McLane took the chair opposite
her. “And how did you leave Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Much more composed; she will be down directly.”</p>

<p>“Getting up? Mrs. McLane, how could you permit
it?” and Mrs. Ogden sat bolt upright and gazed
in disapproval at her guest.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a case of my permitting&mdash;Ethel had
made up her mind to dress and come down stairs, and
nothing I could say would dissuade her,” responded
Lois. She glanced curiously about the drawing room.
“Did the water do much damage?”</p>

<p>“Did it!” Mrs. Ogden’s intonation was eloquent,
but she was too intent on gathering information to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>be switched to another topic, no matter how interesting
it might be. “Do pull your chair closer, Mrs.
McLane; I never can talk to people at arms’ length.
Tell me, don’t you think Ethel is terribly broken up
over Jim Patterson’s death?”</p>

<p>“I think it was a frightful shock to her,” admitted
Lois. “It&mdash;it seemed so unnecessary.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden squirmed in her chair. “My husband
walked the floor all night, completely cut up over
the result of his carelessness in leaving the cartridges
in his desk; but for that James Patterson would be
alive today.”</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Ogden takes too much of the blame
on his shoulders,” said Lois gently. “He was not
responsible for the fire. By the way, have you
learned how it started?”</p>

<p>“The fire inspector and the insurance representative
attributed it to the crossed electric wires,” Mrs.
Ogden moved restlessly. “But they are to make a
more thorough investigation. Will you have some
tea?” stretching out her hand toward the bell.</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” Lois spoke somewhat hastily. “Dr.
McLane will be here very soon to see Ethel, and I
must not keep him waiting when he is ready to
leave.”</p>

<p>“Your husband was so kind last night,” Mrs. Ogden
spoke with genuine feeling. “I don’t know how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>I could have gotten on without him. He attended
to everything, even to interviewing the reporters, and
I’m sure that’s why they are not more sensational in
their accounts of the fire and poor Jim Patterson’s
death.”</p>

<p>“Leonard was glad to do anything that he could
for you, Mrs. Ogden,” leaning forward Lois took
the older woman’s hand and stroked it gently. Shock
and anxiety had left their mark on Mrs. Ogden; her
lips quivered and she seized Lois’ kind hand in a
spasmodic grip.</p>

<p>“If you only knew all I’ve been through,” she
wailed. “Ethel unconscious for so long, and Jim
lying there dead. They wouldn’t take him up and
place him respectably in bed, but must needs leave
him lying on the hall floor like something worthless,
until the coroner came. And then they took him
to the Morgue&mdash;of all places, when he had a large
apartment at the Dresden!”</p>

<p>“But it is the law,” Lois whitened; the present
tragedy brought back memories of another in which
she had been one of the principal figures not so long
since. “In case of sudden or violent death, the
autopsy has to be held at the Morgue.”</p>

<p>“The autopsy!” gasped Mrs. Ogden, horror-stricken.
“You don’t mean they are going to hold
an autopsy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“So my husband said,” Lois spoke more guardedly.
“He asked me to say nothing to Ethel, thinking
it might upset her, so please don’t mention it.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” Mrs. Ogden looked sharply
at her visitor. “I believe Ethel was more deeply
in love with Jim Patterson than she realized, and
now that it is too late she is grieving her heart out.”</p>

<p>Lois did not reply at once. “I think Ethel is
shocked beyond measure, and grieved also,” she interpolated.
“But I do not think that she entertained
any warmer feeling for Jim than friendship.”</p>

<p>“But her emotion on hearing of his death&mdash;her
unconsciousness&mdash;” persisted Mrs. Ogden. “Did
she not speak of Jim to you today?”</p>

<p>Lois checked a smile; she had a feeling that Mrs.
Ogden had been approaching that question ever since
her entrance, and now it was out.</p>

<p>“She mentioned him, yes; and with deep sorrow
and regret for his death&mdash;but that was all,” she said
calmly.</p>

<p>“Ethel is a queer girl,” mused Mrs. Ogden. “I
cannot quite make her out; apparently with all her
<i>bonhomie</i>, she is at bottom reserved. She never
talks of herself, her ills, or her emotions.”</p>

<p>“She has one of the most loyal, lovable natures
I’ve ever known,” exclaimed Lois warmly. “When
Ethel gives her friendship, her affection is given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>whole-heartedly, loyally. I hope sincerely that Jim
Patterson was nothing more than a friend, for if
not, Ethel will never recover from the shock of his
tragic death.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden stirred uneasily. “I fear Ethel must
dree her weird,” she muttered. “Was anything said
of Julian Barclay this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No.” It was Lois’ turn to study her companion.
“I have heard that he is very much in love with
Ethel,” she paused, but Mrs. Ogden made no comment,
and she continued somewhat hurriedly. “Is
Mr. Barclay remaining here through the winter?”</p>

<p>“He is not.” Mrs. Ogden’s decided tone spoke
volumes. “Walter, my husband, is very much displeased
with him; we do not approve”&mdash;she broke
off nervously.</p>

<p>“Then you do not think him a suitable match for
Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, I don’t, and I never dreamed”&mdash;Mrs.
Ogden stopped abruptly. “Julian’s behavior at times
has been a source of grave anxiety to his relations.”</p>

<p>“I confess I was favorably impressed with Mr.
Barclay last night,” Lois remarked. “I am sorry to
learn he is eccentric.”</p>

<p>“Eccentric is hardly the word,” Mrs. Ogden’s
conscience somewhat reproached her for so openly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>criticizing a relative and a guest in her house, but
Julian Barclay was becoming an obsession, and she
could not stop talking about him altogether. “He
is a bit queer&mdash;morbid&mdash;and he is most decidedly
not the man to make Ethel happy. Their&mdash;their
temperaments are too much alike for perfect harmony.”</p>

<p>What comment, if any, Lois would have made,
remained unspoken, as Walter Ogden and Professor
Norcross joined them.</p>

<p>“Walter, do ring for tea!” exclaimed Mrs. Ogden,
after the men had greeted Lois. “Charles should
have brought it before now.”</p>

<p>“We have no time for tea,” replied her husband
brusquely. “We are all summoned to the inquest
on poor Patterson.”</p>

<p>“What? Now?” and his wife looked at him
aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes, immediately; so get your wraps. We have
to go at once to the Morgue. Where’s Ethel?”</p>

<p>“Here,” and turning they beheld Ethel standing
in the doorway. She was but a wraith of the beautiful
girl whose joyous spirit had added so materially
to the enjoyment of the bishop at the dinner the night
before. “Do I understand we are to go to the
Morgue, Cousin Walter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Ogden’s rough tone softened. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>very fond of Ethel. “We won’t be there very long.”</p>

<p>“But why should I go?” asked Ethel.</p>

<p>“Well, eh, the coroner wishes to know why Patterson
was so fool-hardy as to approach the den
when the cartridges were exploding, and there was
some talk of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My having sent him into the den?” Ethel turned
pale, and Lois, observing her emotion, slipped her
arm about her waist. “I did,” Ethel paused to control
her voice. “And I shall never cease to reproach
myself&mdash;I virtually killed James Patterson.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Ogden,” Professor Norcross
turned a shocked face in her direction. “You must
not permit yourself to indulge in such morbid
fancies.”</p>

<p>“It was more my fault than yours, Ethel,” added
Ogden. “I left the cartridges in my desk, and it
was only a merciful Providence that others were
not killed. Now, don’t waste further time, run and
get your wraps.”</p>

<p>Ethel turned to Lois and the appeal in her eyes
was unmistakable. “Won’t you come with me?” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“I will,” Lois’ hearty response brought comfort
to Ethel. “And we can go down in my electric, if
you don’t object, Mrs. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” Mrs. Ogden, having summoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
her maid a few seconds before, was bustling
into the wraps brought her. “Ethel, wrap yourself
up warmly. What about your husband?” suddenly
recollecting Dr. McLane, and wheeling on Lois.
“Will you leave word for him to join you at the
Morgue?”</p>

<p>“I think he is already there,” broke in Ogden impatiently.
“Now, Jane, don’t keep everyone waiting,”
and driving his nervous wife and Professor
Norcross ahead of him, Ogden made his noisy way
to the street, leaving Ethel and Lois to follow more
leisurely.</p>

<p>The speedier touring car of the Ogdens’ brought
them and Professor Norcross to the Morgue some
moments before Lois’ slower electric brougham put
in an appearance, and they waited outside the weather-stained
stuccoed building with some impatience.
Their arrival, however, was observed from inside
the Morgue, and Leonard McLane joined them.</p>

<p>“The inquest has commenced,” he said, and Mrs.
Ogden wondered at his constrained manner. “Your
name has been called as a witness, Mr. Ogden; I
think you had better go in at once.”</p>

<p>“What about Ethel and Mrs. McLane?” Mrs.
Ogden halted on the lower step of the building.
“They are coming in your electric.”</p>

<p>“I will wait for them,” volunteered Professor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>Norcross, and turned back to the cobble-stoned pavement
which did duty for a sidewalk. The Ogdens,
preceded by Leonard McLane, filed through the
hall and into the outer room.</p>

<p>“This room is reserved for witnesses,” observed
McLane, pulling forward a chair for Mrs. Ogden,
and the men present rose; Ogden recognized among
them the fire chief and several of his servants. “Ogden,
this is the Morgue Master,” added McLane, as
a heavily built man stepped toward them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Walter Ogden?” inquired the latter interrogatively.
“Then, sir, kindly step into the court
room with me.” He turned back at the door to
address the others. “Just sit down, all of you, and
your names will be called in due time,” and the door
closed behind him.</p>

<p>Taking but a cursory glance about the court room,
Ogden followed the Morgue Master to the witness
stand, pausing a moment at the base of the platform
to permit the first witness to descend. Ogden, while
waiting for the Morgue Master to administer the
oath to “Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth,” gazed curiously at the six men
composing the jury, who sat upright or lolled back
in their chairs, as each man’s nature inclined him
to take his brief publicity.</p>

<p>The Morgue Master’s authoritative voice brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>Ogden’s attention back to him with a jump, and
after taking the oath he turned to face Coroner
Penfield.</p>

<p>“Your full name?” demanded the coroner.</p>

<p>“Walter Ogden.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been a resident of Washington?”</p>

<p>“Five months.”</p>

<p>“Have you lived here before this winter, Mr.
Ogden?”</p>

<p>“I have never rented a house here before this
winter,” answered Ogden. “But I have made trips
to Washington at different seasons for at least ten
years.”</p>

<p>“Who is the owner of the house you rent?”</p>

<p>“Professor Richard Norcross, the naturalist.”</p>

<p>“He is visiting you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Was the house in good condition when you
took it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, in excellent condition.”</p>

<p>“No trouble with defective flues or smoking chimneys?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea, Mr. Ogden, how the fire
started in your den?”</p>

<p>“Not the faintest,” replied Ogden frankly. “The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>fire chief and insurance inspector seemed to think
it came from crossed electric wires.”</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield frowned. “Their testimony will
be taken later; kindly restrict your replies to your
own opinions. When did you first discover the
fire?”</p>

<p>“While at dinner,” Ogden’s reply was curt, he did
not relish rebukes.</p>

<p>“Were you dining alone?”</p>

<p>“No, my wife and I were giving a dinner.”</p>

<p>“Mention the names of your guests,” directed the
coroner, and he glanced down a list, checking off each
person as Ogden enumerated them. Then he examined
a rough drawing of the Ogden house. “Why
was it that you did not discover the fire until it had
gained such headway?”</p>

<p>“Because the folding doors leading into the hall
and also into the drawing room, were closed.”</p>

<p>“Would you have detected the fire more quickly
if the doors had been open?”</p>

<p>“I think so; the smell of smoke would have
warned us.”</p>

<p>“Is it your custom to keep the folding doors closed
while you are in the dining room?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not.”</p>

<p>“Could they have been closed without your knowledge,
Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Ogden pondered before answering. “I believe so;
heavy portières were pulled across the doorways,
and under cover of the noise occasioned by our talking
and the rattle of dishes, the folding doors could
have been pushed together without attracting my attention,
or being seen by others. But I cannot
imagine why a servant should do it, unless a guest
complained of being cold.”</p>

<p>“With the portières drawn?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There might be draughts even then, and
ladies in evening dress are sometimes sensitive to
cold.” Ogden’s voice was dry, and Penfield
frowned.</p>

<p>“What were cartridges doing in your den, Mr.
Ogden?”</p>

<p>“I put two boxes in my desk drawer on my return
from a hunting trip in Maine last fall.”</p>

<p>“When you found the den was on fire, did you
remember the cartridges?”</p>

<p>“No. I had completely forgotten them, and only
thought of them again when the fire reached the
boxes and exploded them.”</p>

<p>“Who first discovered the fire?”</p>

<p>“One of the servants, I believe. Some one called
‘Fire,’ and we all dashed into the hall,” answered
Ogden vaguely. “I really don’t know who turned
in the fire alarm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Penfield consulted a memorandum. “When did
you last see Mr. James Patterson alive?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Helping my wife and my cousin, Miss Ethel Ogden,
to cross the lower hall, which was filled with
smoke, to reach the sidewalk,” answered Ogden
thoughtfully. “I cannot recall seeing him again. I
accompanied the firemen upstairs, and Patterson
may have brushed by me on the staircase; but if so,
I did not recognize him in the smoke and general excitement.”</p>

<p>“I think that is all just now, Mr. Ogden,” Penfield
laid down his memorandum, and turned to the
Morgue Master. “Ask Professor Norcross to step
here.”</p>

<p>Ogden rose with alacrity to give his seat to the
professor and went hastily from the room, conscious
that reporters were eyeing him apparently eager for
an interview. But he did not loiter in closing the
door between himself and the news-gatherers, and the
reporters turned their eyes back to Professor
Norcross.</p>

<p>“Washington is my legal residence,” the professor
said a few minutes later after answering the coroner’s
question as to his age, occupation, and length of residence
in Washington. “I spend a few weeks of
every year here, and own the house now leased to
Mr. Walter Ogden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“Have you, or your other tenants, ever had a fire
in your house?”</p>

<p>“Once, a number of years ago, a chimney caught
fire, but since then I have had a new system of heating
installed, and no more trouble has arisen.”</p>

<p>“Is your house covered by fire insurance, Professor?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>Penfield consulted the deputy coroner before asking
another question, and Norcross spent his time
inspecting the spectators who lounged about the court
room. He wondered if they had come only to hear
the evidence in the inquest on James Patterson, or if
they were the <i>habitués</i> of the place. He had heard
of the morbidly curious who haunted the scenes of
crime and the Morgue, and the dress and deportment
of the majority of the people in the room indicated
they were from the poorer classes. A few women
sat in one corner, and Norcross was surprised to find
Lois McLane occupying a chair near them. She was
evidently not to be called as a witness.</p>

<p>“Professor Norcross,” the coroner turned back to
the witness chair. “Did you hear the closing of the
folding doors to the dining room?”</p>

<p>Norcross smiled. “I did not hear them being
shut, but they were closed by the butler at my direction
shortly after we entered the dining room,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>said. “Madame Takasaki, wife of the Japanese
attaché, complained of being cold, and as she sat in
a direct draft with the opening and closing of the
pantry door, I had the folding doors closed at once.”</p>

<p>“When did you last see Mr. James Patterson?”</p>

<p>“At the front door of the Ogden house as he stood
talking with Miss Ethel Ogden.”</p>

<p>“What transpired then?” asked the coroner, as
Norcross paused.</p>

<p>“Mr. Patterson persuaded Miss Ogden not to
enter the house, and then disappeared inside,”
answered Norcross. “After seeing Miss Ogden join
her cousin, I also went into the house, hoping to be
of some assistance to Mr. Ogden.”</p>

<p>“And that was the last you saw of Mr. Patterson?”
persisted the coroner.</p>

<p>“Yes. Mr. Takasaki, the Japanese attaché,
stopped me on the staircase to ask for his wife, and
when I reached the second story Mr. Patterson was
nowhere in sight.”</p>

<p>“You are excused, Professor,” said Penfield, and
Norcross departed.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CORONER ASKS QUESTIONS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next to occupy the witness chair was the fire
chief. He answered briefly the questions put
to him, and Lois McLane, beginning to feel the closeness
of the atmosphere, longed for his departure. She
had promised Ethel to stay and take her home, and
the Morgue Master had assured her that Ethel
would probably be called to the stand after the fire
chief had given his testimony.</p>

<p>“You think then, that the fire was started by defective
electric wires?” asked Penfield.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Was much damage done?”</p>

<p>“The walls and floors were badly damaged, while
the rugs, curtains, and several pieces of furniture
were totally destroyed.”</p>

<p>“What caused the dense smoke, of which Mr.
Ogden and other witnesses speak, if the fire was, as
you testify, confined to a comparatively small space?”
inquired Coroner Penfield.</p>

<p>“The fire had apparently smoldered in the walls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>of the room, and on its bursting out, ignited a davenport
on which were numerous pillows; all the chairs
in the room were tufted, and when they caught as
well as the velvet hangings, it added to the density of
the smoke. But for the discharge of two boxes of
cartridges, my men could have put out the fire much
more quickly.”</p>

<p>“Did these cartridges go off in only one direction,
Chief?”</p>

<p>“No; on the contrary they scattered in every direction,
and I found bullet holes even in the house
next door to the Ogdens’. In several instances my
men’s helmets were pierced by them.”</p>

<p>“What caliber were the bullets, Chief?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-eight&mdash;for use in rifles,” as he spoke, the
fire chief pulled a handful of brass shells and bullets
from his pocket. “I picked these up after the fire
was out, and took the bullets out of the walls.”</p>

<p>“Did the bullets penetrate through the walls to the
hall beyond?”</p>

<p>“No; but the two doors to the den were open, and
the bullets also went through the windows, and that is
the way they reached the next house.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Mr. James Patterson alive when you
entered the Ogden residence?” asked the coroner,
handing the brass shells and bullets to the foreman
of the jury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“No; I only reached the house a few seconds
before the igniting of the cartridges, and Mr. Patterson
was found in the lower end of the hall, toward
the back stairs.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the position of Mr. Patterson’s
body?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dr. McLane sent for me at once on finding
the body.”</p>

<p>The coroner toyed for a second with his pencil,
then tossed it on the high desk before which he was
sitting. “Had the body been moved?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Dr. McLane told me that it had not.”</p>

<p>“In your opinion, Chief, could a bullet from the
cartridges in the burning room have reached Mr.
Patterson when standing over the spot where his
body was later found lying?”</p>

<p>The coroner’s question electrified Lois McLane,
as well as the others in the room. What did he
mean to imply by his question? The fire chief was
some seconds in answering.</p>

<p>“I carefully measured the distance.” As he spoke
the fire chief reached over and took up a pad and
pencil from the coroner’s desk. “Here,” he said,
drawing a rough outline of the hall and rooms opening
from it. “Mr. Patterson must have been standing
at this point when shot, judging from where his
body was found. The hall curves just at the point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>where the two doors, leading from Mr. Walter
Ogden’s room and the den open into it, and on the
opposite side, but a little further down the hall, is
a bullet proof safe. The bullet evidently struck the
safe, ricocheted down the hall to where Mr. Patterson
was standing and penetrated his back.”</p>

<p>“Were there any marks on the safe, Chief?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite distinct marks where the bullet struck.”</p>

<p>At the answer Lois drew a long breath of relief;
her too active imagination had attributed unnecessary
meaning to the coroner’s first question; and she
listened with abating interest to the few questions
Coroner Penfield asked the fire chief before dismissing
him. The latter was just leaving the platform
when Penfield called him back.</p>

<p>“One moment,” he exclaimed. “Was any piece
of furniture left intact in the burning room?”</p>

<p>“A desk between the two doors leading to the hall
and Ogden’s bedroom, was badly scorched, but being
of metal was not seriously damaged. The fire apparently
had just gotten to it a few minutes before
my men entered.”</p>

<p>“How about Mr. Ogden’s desk in which he kept
his boxes of cartridges?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was directly in the line of fire, and was
burned to a crisp; nothing was left of it but a heap
of smoldering ashes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>The coroner dropped his pencil, which he had
picked up to scribble a hasty note, and nodded to the
fire chief.</p>

<p>“I have finished, thank you,” and as the man
stepped down, he spoke to the Morgue Master.
“Tell Charles Whelan, the Ogden butler, to step
here,” and Lois McLane sank back in her chair in
disappointment; apparently she would have to remain
indefinitely at the Morgue.</p>

<p>That Charles did not enjoy being a witness was
plain to be seen from his demeanor, and Lois pitied
the man as he sat on the extreme edge of his chair,
his hands playing nervously with his hat. His voice,
as the Morgue Master administered the oath, could
scarcely be heard two feet away, and he was cautioned
to speak louder.</p>

<p>“What is your full name?” inquired Penfield, trying
by his reassuring manner to put the servant at
ease.</p>

<p>“Charles Wilson Whelan, sor, thank you, sor.”</p>

<p>“Occupation?”</p>

<p>“A butler, sor.”</p>

<p>“And have you lived long with Mr. and Mrs.
Ogden, Charles?”</p>

<p>“Since October, sor.” Charles fumbled in one of
his pockets and produced a number of soiled papers.
“Here’s me references, sor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, Charles, but I don’t require them,” said
the coroner kindly.</p>

<p>Charles looked blank. “Sure, sor, I thought you
was inquirin’ into me character, sor.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Charles; we just want you to tell us
what you know about the fire at the Ogden’s last
night.”</p>

<p>“The fire, is it?” Charles brightened. “Sure, I
know nothin’ about it&mdash;never dhreamed of such an
awful thing until I heard a voice call ‘Fire,’ and I
bolted into the pantry to warn the other servants
who were there and below stairs.”</p>

<p>“Which of the servants gave the warning of fire?”</p>

<p>“None of ’em, sor; they was all in the pantry or
below stairs.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you smell smoke in your pantry,
Charles?”</p>

<p>“No, sor,” and seeing the coroner’s dubious expression,
the butler added hastily, “Sure, our cook
had burned the cream sauce, and the smell of that
just filled the pantry.”</p>

<p>“How many servants, besides yourself, does Mr.
Ogden employ?”</p>

<p>“The cook, the chambermaid, Mrs. Ogden’s maid,
the parlor maid, the furnace man, and meself,”
Charles checked them off on his fingers. “But Mrs.
Ogden fired the parlor maid, Rose, yesterday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>mornin,’ and there was three extra help for the dinner,
Emma, the crack cook, and the waiters from
Rauscher’s. That’s all, sor.”</p>

<p>“I see.” The coroner laid the list of names on his
desk. “Where do you keep the silver, Charles?”</p>

<p>“Down in the dining room in the daytime, but
I takes it upstairs every night and puts it in the
safe just at the end of the hall.” The butler paused
and stared doubtfully at the jury, then coming to a
sudden decision, he turned back to the coroner. “Sure,
there was a burglar at the Ogdens’ the night before
the fire.”</p>

<p>“A burglar?” The coroner’s interest quickened.
“Did he steal anything?”</p>

<p>“No, sor; Mr. Julian Barclay scared him off before
he had time to.”</p>

<p>“When did you last see Mr. Patterson alive,
Charles?”</p>

<p>“Whin all the guests piled out of the dining room
at the call of ‘Fire’.”</p>

<p>“And that was the last time?” Charles nodded
vigorously. “Well, I think that is all; much obliged,
Charles,” and the butler, much gratified by the coroner’s
manner, descended hastily from the platform
and slipped from the room.</p>

<p>The next witnesses, heard in rapid succession, were
the Ogdens’ other servants; each corroborated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>Charles’ statement that they were either in the pantry
or in the kitchen, and had not realized the house
was on fire until Charles had called to them; they
also stated that the smell of scorched cream on the
kitchen range had probably concealed any smell of
burning which might have drifted into the basement.
As the last servant left the witness chair, the coroner
called to the Morgue Master.</p>

<p>“Ask Miss Ethel Ogden to step here,” he directed,
and Lois McLane looked eagerly toward the door
as it opened and Ethel walked in. The coroner met
her at the foot of the platform and assisted her to
the witness chair.</p>

<p>In spite of her white face and wildly beating heart,
Ethel was outwardly composed, and her clear voice
could be heard at the far end of the room as she took
the oath and answered the preliminary questions put
to her by the coroner.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, Miss Ogden,” began Penfield,
after a brief silence, “who among the guests at the
dinner last night first called ‘Fire’?”</p>

<p>Ethel shook her head. “The voice seemed to
come from the direction of the drawing room.”</p>

<p>“Could you recognize it?”</p>

<p>“N-no; it was too hoarse, too discordant to be
recognizable.”</p>

<p>“Who sat nearest the drawing room entrance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Ethel considered a moment. “I believe Mrs.
Leonard McLane and Mr. Julian Barclay sat directly
in front of the drawing room doors, but a huge
centerpiece of flowers prevented my seeing that part
of the table.”</p>

<p>The coroner turned in his chair and faced her
squarely. “When did you last see Mr. James Patterson
alive?” he asked.</p>

<p>“As he went up the staircase to the second floor,”
Ethel’s voice quivered, and her eyes filled with tears.
Jim Patterson had, through his unfortunately jealous
disposition forfeited her friendship, but he had met
his death bravely, while endeavoring to carry out her
last request, and his memory should be sacred.</p>

<p>“I have been told that it was at your request that
Mr. Patterson attempted to enter the burning room.”
Coroner Penfield paused, then asked impressively,
“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I bitterly regret&mdash;” she choked and
broke down.</p>

<p>“I understand,” said Penfield sympathetically, and
waited considerately for her to regain her composure.
“And what did you ask Mr. Patterson to procure
for you from the burning room?” He waited an appreciable
moment for a reply, and not getting it,
repeated his question more emphatically.</p>

<p>“I asked him to get something out of my desk in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>the den,” said Ethel at last, and both Coroner Penfield
and Lois McLane took silent note of her unwilling
almost sullen tone. “I could see from across
the street that the fire seemed to be raging about
the front of the room and judged that my desk was
not in the direct line of fire. I started into the house,
intending to go upstairs myself, but Mr. Patterson
stopped me at the front door and&mdash;and&mdash;went instead.
Oh, I wish he hadn’t,” she added. “I shall
always reproach myself.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ogden,” Penfield touched her sympathetically
on her arm to attract her attention from her
bitter thoughts, “was Mr. Patterson successful&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Successful?” she echoed, uncomprehendingly.
“Why, he was killed.”</p>

<p>“Successful in procuring what you sent him for, I
mean,” explained Penfield hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I found one of the articles I asked him to bring
me in the desk this morning; the other was gone.”</p>

<p>“And you infer&mdash;?” persisted the coroner, as Ethel
stopped.</p>

<p>“That Mr. Patterson picked up one article and,
perhaps driven back by advancing flames, had not
time to find the other.”</p>

<p>“What were these articles?”</p>

<p>Ethel stiffened at the question. It was the one she
dreaded. Was her secret to be laid bare? Was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>Julian Barclay to know that she valued his ring and
his miniature of her at so high a price that she had
sent a man to his death to get them for her? So
open a confession of her passionate attachment to
him stung her proud and sensitive nature to the
quick.</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield gave her no time to consider her
answer.</p>

<p>“I must ask you to reply promptly,” he said
brusquely, glancing significantly at the wall clock.
“You are unnecessarily wasting the time of the court.
Quickly now, what were these articles?”</p>

<p>“A ring and a miniature,” she answered confusedly.</p>

<p>“And which article did Mr. Patterson find?”</p>

<p>“The miniature, as the ring was still in the desk
drawer.”</p>

<p>“Of whom was the miniature?”</p>

<p>“Of myself,” replied Ethel faintly. She did not
look at Lois, and missed her sudden start and low-toned
ejaculation.</p>

<p>“Have you recovered the miniature from among
Mr. Patterson’s effects?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Not yet; I&mdash;I fainted on hearing of Mr. Patterson’s
death, and when I felt equal to making inquiries,
I was told that Dr. McLane had turned over
everything found in Mr. Patterson’s possession to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>the police. I have not seen Dr. McLane since learning
this.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Coroner Penfield contemplated her
thoughtfully. The delicate, refined beauty of her
young face, her trim figure and stylish clothes all
possessed unconscious appeal, and Penfield, seeing
her effort at forced composure, altered his plans.</p>

<p>“I will not detain you farther,” he announced.
“Look out for that bottom step,” and Ethel thankfully
accepted his assistance, conscious that her knees
were trembling under her. But her ordeal in the
witness chair had been briefer than she had dared to
hope, and a ghost of a smile touched her lips at sight
of Lois McLane standing by the doorway.</p>

<p>The two friends left the court room together, but
on the other side of the door Ethel halted involuntarily,
for at their entrance Julian Barclay had turned
from moody contemplation of the few pictures the
room boasted, and approached them. He shook
hands with Mrs. McLane, his gaze traveling over
her shoulder to Ethel.</p>

<p>As their eyes met, Ethel almost cried out, there
was such dumb agonizing appeal in his dark eyes.
She leaned impulsively forward, but the words on her
parted lips were checked by the entrance of the
Morgue Master.</p>

<p>“You are wanted, Mr. Barclay,” he announced.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ith</span> a muttered apology, which Ethel but
half caught, Julian Barclay stepped by them
and went immediately into the courtroom. The
spectators had thinned out appreciably as the inquest
continued, and but a handful of people heard the
Morgue Master’s slightly hoarse voice administer
the oath to Barclay.</p>

<p>“Your full name?” inquired Coroner Penfield as
Barclay seated himself in the witness chair.</p>

<p>“Julian Barclay.”</p>

<p>“Your occupation?”</p>

<p>Barclay’s fingers, which were beating a noiseless
tattoo on the side of his chair, suddenly stiffened,
but his voice was tranquil as he answered the coroner.</p>

<p>“I write,” he said. “And spend most of my time
knocking about the world looking for material.”</p>

<p>“And your legal residence, Mr. Barclay?”</p>

<p>“I have none; I am not a voter,” smiled Barclay.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>“Sometimes I winter in Cairo, sometimes in China.”</p>

<p>“And your reasons for being in Washington this
winter?”</p>

<p>“I came to visit my cousin, Mrs. Walter Ogden,
and her husband. I have been with them nearly a
month now.”</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence as Coroner Penfield
sorted the papers on his desk, then he turned
again to Barclay. “At the dinner last night, Mr.
Barclay, were you sitting with your back to the drawing
room doors?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell us who first gave the warning that
the house was on fire?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Barclay fingered his watch fob, and
crossed his legs. “Yes. It was the Japanese, Yoshida
Ito.”</p>

<p>Penfield, as well as the jury and the reporters,
eyed him in surprise.</p>

<p>“A Japanese?” repeated Penfield. “Was he a
guest at the dinner?”</p>

<p>“No. He poked his head through the portières
before the drawing room doorway, and shouted
‘Fire.’”</p>

<p>“Is this Yoshida Ito a servant?” asked Penfield,
picking up a list of names from among his papers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>
<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then if he was neither a guest nor a servant,
what was he doing in the Ogden house?” demanded
the coroner sternly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” responded Barclay, his bewilderment
written in his expression and gesture. “I
found him in the house the night before the fire, and
chased him out.”</p>

<p>“Was this Japanese the burglar of whom Charles,
the butler, spoke in his testimony?”</p>

<p>“I presume so.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this Ito set fire to the house?”</p>

<p>“Such is my theory,” returned Barclay. “He evidently
fired the house with the intention of stealing
valuables he could not get the night before.”</p>

<p>The coroner looked incredulous. “If he set the
room on fire with any such intention, why should he
warn Mr. Ogden and his guests?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t answer that,” said Barclay
slowly. “But you should recollect that the cleverest
criminals are sometimes guilty of inconsistent
actions.”</p>

<p>“I am quite aware of that,” acknowledged the coroner
dryly. “Have you other evidence to bear out
your theory?”</p>

<p>“Only that, on rushing to the portières intending to
pass through them into the drawing room, I found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>the folding doors behind the portières closed and
locked.”</p>

<p>“Locked!” echoed Penfield.</p>

<p>“Yes,” impatiently. “The Jap evidently called his
warning, locked us in, and secreted himself somewhere,
intending to remain hidden until everyone
was out of the house&mdash;and he could steal at his
leisure.”</p>

<p>“With the house on fire?” Penfield concealed a
smile behind his hand.</p>

<p>“It does not take long to steal with the coast clear.
The fire was on the second floor, remember,” argued
Barclay. “He evidently locked the drawing room
door to force Ogden and his guests to seek egress
from the room by the hall, and thus minimize the
risk he ran of being discovered by a chance encounter,
which might have occurred had some of the guests
fled through the drawing room.”</p>

<p>“It is an ingenious theory,” commented Penfield
slowly. “Where were you during the fire?”</p>

<p>“Searching for Ito.”</p>

<p>“And did you find him?”</p>

<p>“No; I could find absolutely no trace of him,”
observing Penfield’s expression, Barclay added hastily,
“The Jap saw me, saw that I recognized him,
and, I believe, gave up his well arranged plan and
bolted, escaping unseen in the confusion.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>
<p>“That may be so,” Penfield silently contemplated
Barclay for a short moment. “Did anyone else
see the Jap?” he inquired more briskly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; they have not spoken of it to me.”</p>

<p>“Why have you not told all this to Mr. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“For two reasons,” Barclay spoke with deliberation.
“Mr. Ogden told me he had no time to listen
to my theories this morning, and I received notification
soon after that I was to testify here this
afternoon. I have not seen Mr. Ogden to talk to
in the interval.”</p>

<p>“When did you last see Mr. James Patterson
alive?” and the repeatedly asked question stirred the
jury to greater attention.</p>

<p>“In the rush from the dining room into the hall.”</p>

<p>“What, not again?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Barclay. “I believe Patterson assisted
the ladies in reaching the street, but after opening
the front door to admit the firemen, I rushed into
the drawing room and finding no sign of Ito there
unlocked the dining room door, passed through there,
thinking the Jap might be trying to steal the silver,
and then rushed upstairs by the back way.”</p>

<p>“Were you the first to find Mr. Patterson’s body?”
inquired Penfield.</p>

<p>“Yes. I stumbled across it as I was coming down
from my fruitless search for Ito.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Exactly how was the body lying when you found
it?”</p>

<p>“Face down,” answered Barclay, demonstrating
with his hands to illustrate his meaning, “in this position.
Not recognizing Patterson, I turned him
partly over to see who it was, and to render what
aid I could. I thought he had been overcome by
smoke.”</p>

<p>“You say you did not recognize Patterson at once;
was there no light in the hall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the hall was filled with smoke and I
could not see clearly. Secondly,” added Barclay
dryly, “one man in a dress suit is very much like another,
and especially when lying on his back.”</p>

<p>“Exactly where did you find Patterson’s body?”
Penfield asked, handing Barclay a photograph of
the hall. “This photograph was taken this morning.”</p>

<p>Barclay studied it with interest. “I found Patterson
right here,” indicating the spot, and Coroner
Penfield marked it with his pencil.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, right under the hall light,” he said.
“You say you thought Patterson overcome by the
smoke; did you find no trace of blood from the bullet
wound in his back?”</p>

<p>“I have already explained that I could see but
dimly in the smoke-filled hall,” answered Barclay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>impatiently. “And Dr. McLane can tell you that
the wound bled superficially.”</p>

<p>The coroner turned again to consult the notes
made by the deputy coroner. “You state that you
found Patterson by stumbling over him. Did you
thus accidentally change the position of his body?”</p>

<p>“I think not. Stumble was more a figure of
speech. I regret that I stepped on his hand at first,
and the feeling of soft flesh giving under my weight
caused me to drop on my knees, and I found his
body right in front of me.”</p>

<p>“Which way was his head lying?”</p>

<p>“Toward me.”</p>

<p>“Was Patterson holding anything in his hands?”
asked Penfield.</p>

<p>“Not a thing.” And Barclay’s gaze did not shift
before the coroner’s penetrating look.</p>

<p>“I think that is all,” announced Penfield. “Stay a
moment, are you quite sure that none of the other
guests saw this Japanese, Yoshida Ito?”</p>

<p>“They did not mention it to me after the fire,”
replied Barclay, pausing at the edge of the platform.
“It may not be of any consequence, but I saw Ito
talking to James Patterson before the dinner in front
of the Ogden residence.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” Penfield regarded Barclay attentively.
“And what were Patterson and Ito discussing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“I did not overhear their conversation,” Barclay
hesitated. “I only mention the meeting because you
seemed to want corroboration of my having seen Ito
around the Ogden premises, and because&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” The interrogation shot from Penfield as
Barclay paused.</p>

<p>“Because I was surprised at seeing James Patterson
conversing with a Japanese when I was aware
of his well-known animosity to that nation.”</p>

<p>“Did the conversation appear to be of a friendly
character?”</p>

<p>“Apparently so. Patterson did most of the
talking.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the Japanese?”</p>

<p>“He disappeared up the street.”</p>

<p>“Did Patterson speak of meeting the Japanese
on entering the house?”</p>

<p>“Not to me,” Barclay moved restlessly. “We
talked of other topics.”</p>

<p>“Just one more question,” Penfield rose. “Did
Patterson see Ito when the Japanese poked his head
inside the portières and shouted, ‘Fire’?”</p>

<p>“He might easily have seen him,” exclaimed Barclay.
“The drawing room doorway was directly behind
Mrs. Leonard McLane; and Patterson and I
sat on either side of her.”</p>

<p>“So that he could have seen the Japanese as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>readily as you?” Barclay nodded. “Thank you,
Mr. Barclay, that is all,” and Barclay hastened from
the room. Coroner Penfield leaned over and whispered
a few words to the deputy coroner, and they
were still talking when the Morgue Master showed
Leonard McLane to the witness stand and administered
the oath to him.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, Dr. McLane, if you saw a Japanese,
named Yoshida Ito in the Ogden house last
night?” inquired Penfield, having previously asked
him his name, occupation, and length of residence in
Washington.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I did,” answered McLane
thoughtfully. “Great confusion prevailed however,
and the smoke was dense at times; men, whom I took
to be firemen, passed me on the staircase and in the
upper hall, but I cannot swear to their identity.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard the name of Yoshida Ito
before?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and after a pause, McLane added, “In
connection with the mysterious murder of my cousin,
Dwight Tilghman. The inquest at Atlanta brought
a verdict of guilty against him for that crime, but
so far, the Japanese has escaped arrest.”</p>

<p>“Of course.” Penfield colored with mortification.
“Ito’s name struck me as familiar, but I had
for the moment forgotten where I had heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“When did you last see James Patterson alive?”</p>

<p>“When he rushed past me in the lower hall. I ran
upstairs a few minutes later, but the smoke was so
dense the men about me were like shadows, and I
could not distinguish one from the other.”</p>

<p>“When did you first hear of James Patterson’s
death?”</p>

<p>“On my way through the house to open windows.
I came across Julian Barclay bending over a man
lying on the floor. He informed me that it was
James Patterson, and that he had been overcome by
the smoke.”</p>

<p>“Was Mr. Barclay kneeling by the body when
you first saw him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing?”</p>

<p>McLane shot a questioning look at the coroner’s
expressionless face. “Barclay appeared to be testing
Patterson’s pulse when I reached him,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“How was the body lying?”</p>

<p>“Partly on one side; the head, one hand tossed
above it, lay toward the back stairs, and the feet
pointed toward the burning room.”</p>

<p>“Were Patterson’s hands open or closed?”</p>

<p>“Open,” McLane stopped, then continued more
slowly. “Judging from his position I should say that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>Patterson had first fallen on his knees and then
plunged forward on his face, his hands looked as if
he had braced them to break his fall.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barclay testified that he had turned the
body over to see who it was,” put in the coroner
quickly.</p>

<p>“So he had, but only partly to one side; Patterson’s
legs were still doubled up under him.”</p>

<p>“Was there much blood on Patterson’s clothes
and about the floor where he lay?”</p>

<p>“No, very little; the bullet penetrated a vital point
under the shoulder blade, and the wound bled internally.”</p>

<p>“How long should you say Patterson lived after
being shot?”</p>

<p>“Possibly three minutes; not longer.”</p>

<p>“How soon after the extinguishing of the fire did
you find Mr. Barclay bending over Patterson’s
body?”</p>

<p>“Almost immediately&mdash;say three or four minutes.
The whole fire,” added McLane, “from the time of
its discovery until it was extinguished, only lasted
twenty-five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Quick work,” commented the coroner.</p>

<p>“It would have been extinguished quicker but for
the discharge of the cartridges,” explained McLane,
“And also it had gained frightful headway before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>we awoke to the fact that the house was on fire.”</p>

<p>“Did you find any bullets in the walls, Doctor, and
examine them?”</p>

<p>“I pried out several, and also picked up some brass
shells.” McLane took them from his pocket and
passed them over to the coroner. “They are for
rifles, and are thirty-eight caliber.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Penfield added them to the ones left
by Walter Ogden. “You took charge of Patterson’s
body, did you not?”</p>

<p>“I did, until the arrival of the police.”</p>

<p>“Did you turn over Patterson’s personal effects to
the police also?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Was there a miniature of Miss Ethel Ogden
among his belongings?”</p>

<p>“A miniature of Miss Ogden?” repeated McLane,
blankly. “No. I gave Detective Mitchell all I
found in Patterson’s pockets; a leather wallet, a
bunch of keys, gold cigarette case, watch and fob.
I feel sure I would have remembered a miniature
if it had been with the other things.”</p>

<p>Penfield scribbled a line and passed the folded note
to the Morgue Master, then he again addressed
Leonard McLane.</p>

<p>“We won’t detain you longer, Doctor,” and
hardly waiting for McLane to vacate the chair, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>called the deputy coroner to the stand. The preliminaries
were quickly gone through with, and then
the coroner took the witness.</p>

<p>“You performed the autopsy on James Patterson,
did you not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I did; in the presence of the Morgue Master
and Dr. Leonard McLane.”</p>

<p>“And what was the cause of death, Dr. Mayo?”</p>

<p>The deputy coroner held up an anatomical chart
and traced a line on it with the reverse end of his
pencil.</p>

<p>“James Patterson was struck by a bullet under
the shoulder blade which penetrated a vital point,
and he died probably within three to five minutes of
the time he was struck.”</p>

<p>“You probed for the bullet?”</p>

<p>“I did,” Dr. Mayo laid down the chart and took
a small piece of lead from his pocket. “It was shot
from a thirty-two revolver.”</p>

<p>The deputy coroner’s words acted as a live wire
upon the few reporters present, while men sitting
in the back of the court room, crowded forward to
vacant front seats, eager curiosity stirring each and
all. The deputy coroner’s words promised a sensation,
and they did not mean to miss one word of
future proceedings.</p>

<p>“You contend then that James Patterson was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>killed by a bullet from a thirty-two caliber revolver,
Doctor Mayo?” asked Penfield.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, that is all,” and Mayo returned to
his desk, while the Morgue Master took his place
in the witness chair and corroborated his testimony.</p>

<p>“Recall Mr. Walter Ogden,” directed Penfield, as
the Morgue Master stepped down from the platform,
and a second later Ogden was once again in
the witness chair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ogden,” began Penfield. “You testified regarding
cartridges for your rifle; why did you not
mention that you also kept cartridges to fit a thirty-two
caliber revolver in your desk in the den?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t own a revolver,” declared Ogden.
“And I had only thirty-eight caliber rifle cartridges
in my desk. I am speaking on oath,” he
added, seeing Penfield’s dubious expression.</p>

<p>“Then probably a revolver cartridge got accidentally
slipped among your rifle cartridges,” suggested
the coroner.</p>

<p>“No, it didn’t,” retorted Ogden. “The two unopened
boxes contained thirty-eight caliber rifle
cartridges which the shop was late in delivering, and
I did not take them to Maine with me. In fact, my
wife never untied the bundle but placed it just as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>came from the shop in my desk drawer. She is in
the next room and can verify my statement.”</p>

<p>“You are excused,” announced Penfield, curtly,
and turning, ordered the Morgue Master to bring in
Mrs. Ogden.</p>

<p>Although plainly agitated over her first appearance
at an inquest, Mrs. Ogden was concise in her answers
to the coroner’s questions, assuring him that the package
of cartridges had never had the seal on the boxes
broken, and that they had remained for several
months in her husband’s desk, forgotten by both
until the unfortunate fire of the night before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden was followed on the stand by Detective
Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Did Dr. Leonard McLane turn over to you
James Patterson’s personal effects when you reached
the Ogden residence last night?” inquired Penfield.</p>

<p>“He did, sir, and here they are,” Mitchell took
from his pocket a gold watch and fob, a cigarette
case, a bill folder, and a bunch of keys and handed
them to the coroner, who examined each article before
passing it on to the jury.</p>

<p>“Is this all?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Every single article,” declared Mitchell. “Dr.
McLane and I searched Mr. Patterson’s pockets and
that was all we found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“You are sure a miniature of Miss Ethel Ogden
was not among Patterson’s belongings?”</p>

<p>“I am positive it was not,” stated Mitchell. “I
would not have overlooked a miniature.”</p>

<p>“Did you examine the vicinity where Patterson’s
body was found?”</p>

<p>“I did; the body was not moved until after I
reached the house.”</p>

<p>“Did you see a miniature lying in the hall?”</p>

<p>“I did not,” Mitchell stroked his chin thoughtfully.
“I don’t believe it could have been carried
off if Mr. Patterson dropped it when he fell, because
Dr. McLane stationed firemen at either end of the
hall with instructions to let no one pass until the
police arrived. If the miniature was in the hall
either he or I would have found it. These two firemen
are just outside.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” as the detective rose&mdash;“Did you examine
any of the bullets and brass shells which were exploded
by the fire?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir; they were all thirty-eight caliber, and
for use in a rifle.”</p>

<p>“You found none of thirty-two caliber?”</p>

<p>“None, sir.”</p>

<p>“That is all.” Penfield closed his memorandum
book with a snap, and directed the attendance of the
first fireman, who testified that no one had been permitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
in the hall in the neighborhood of Patterson’s
body until it had been removed. He stated that
even from the doorway of the den it had been impossible
to see to the end of the back hall. His mate
testified to the same effect, but on Penfield’s persistent
questioning, admitted that he had seen a Japanese,
but whether it was down in the front hall, or
upstairs near the burning room he could not recollect.</p>

<p>On the dismissal of the last witness Coroner Penfield
arose and addressed the jury.</p>

<p>“Evidence goes to prove that James Patterson was
killed by a bullet fired from a thirty-two caliber revolver,”
he said. “Evidence also goes to prove that
all bullets discharged from the cartridges ignited by
the fire were of thirty-eight caliber and for use in
rifles. A reliable witness has told you of the presence
in the Ogden residence of a Japanese, Yoshida
Ito, a fugitive from justice, already charged with
murder.</p>

<p>“These are the facts,” Penfield paused, then resumed.
“But in considering the evidence you must
bear in mind that it is within possibility that a thirty-two
caliber revolver cartridge was accidentally
packed in the box of thirty-eight caliber rifle cartridges.</p>

<p>“It is for you, gentlemen of the jury, to decide if
James Patterson was killed by the accidental discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
of a box of thirty-eight caliber rifle cartridges,
which might have contained one thirty-two caliber
revolver cartridge, or whether he was shot by a
Japanese burglar carrying a thirty-two caliber revolver
with murderous intent.”</p>

<p>As the coroner ceased speaking the jury filed out
of the room, and for a time nothing was heard but
the rustle of paper and scratching of pens as the
reporters hurriedly arranged their copy. At the end
of an hour the jury was back in the room, and signs
of past dissensions were indicated in each man’s
flushed countenance as they faced the coroner, who
had risen at their entrance.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen of the jury,” Penfield’s sharp voice
broke the stillness. “What is your verdict?”</p>

<p>“We find,” answered the foreman, and paused to
clear his throat. “We find that Representative
James Patterson came to his death in the city of
Washington, in the residence of Walter Ogden, by
a bullet fired from a thirty-two caliber revolver in
the hands of a person or persons unknown.”</p>

<span class="smaller">UNEXPECTED EVIDENCE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> was an uncomfortable silence in the
Ogdens’ drawing room, which no one cared
to break, and Charles, the butler, his equilibrium not
fully restored since his appearance at the inquest that
afternoon, rattled the cups and saucers on his silver
tray as he passed the after-dinner coffee in a way
which set Mrs. Ogden’s teeth on edge.</p>

<p>“There, there, run along,” she exclaimed in an
annoyed aside and dropping her usual dignified manner
of addressing her servants. “And whatever you
do, Charles, <i>don’t</i> rattle the silver in the dining room.
Small noises,” she added, addressing Professor Norcross,
who sat not far from her, “small noises are
more upsetting than big ones.”</p>

<p>“On the same principle that human nature can
face undaunted the emergencies of life, and succumb
to every day trivial annoyances,” answered the professor,
stirring his coffee. “You must be worn out,
Mrs. Ogden, with all that you have been through
during the past twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>His sympathetic tone brought tears to her eyes.
“Isn’t it awful?” she moaned. “The fire was bad
enough, but now&mdash;murder! Oh, Walter, why did
you ever rent so unlucky a house?”</p>

<p>Ogden threw down the magazine he had been
glancing over. “A tactless speech, Jane,” and he
frowned at his wife. “Sorry, Norcross.”</p>

<p>“That I own this house is incidental,” put in
Norcross quickly, as Mrs. Ogden colored in confusion.
“You haven’t hurt my feelings a bit. I have
no association with this house; I merely bought it as
an investment, and to keep my legal residence in
Washington.”</p>

<p>“I spoke hastily,” admitted Mrs. Ogden. “It is
really we who are unlucky; no,” correcting herself,
“everything ran smoothly until Julian Barclay appeared,
and since his arrival things have gone at
sixes and sevens. He seems to attract bad luck&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Norcross looked at her inquiringly, waiting
for her to complete the sentence, but Mrs. Ogden’s
active mind had gone off at a tangent and she
ruminated in silence, a silence unbroken by her two
companions.</p>

<p>“I suppose we are forced to believe that poor
James Patterson was murdered,” she stated suddenly.
“But I think it was horrid of the jury not to
bring in a verdict convicting the Japanese, Ito; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>to say Jim was killed by a person, or persons, unknown&mdash;why”&mdash;drawing
herself erect. “We might
infer from that that one of us was guilty!”</p>

<p>“We are likely to be pestered by detectives,”
grumbled Ogden, rising and moving restlessly about
the room. “I’m beginning to think the packers, in
putting up those cartridges, slipped one of the thirty-two
caliber among the others, and Jim was accidentally
shot after all.”</p>

<p>“The element of chance predominates in that
theory,” argued Norcross, rising as Ethel Ogden
came into the room. “Chance that the revolver
cartridge was among the others, chance that Jim Patterson
stood exactly where he could be hit by that
<i>one</i> cartridge. No, Ogden, I would have believed
your theory also, if there had been another thirty-two
caliber bullet found among those scattered about
the premises. As it is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“As it is?” echoed Ethel, bending eagerly forward.
“You think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The jury found the only verdict it could&mdash;an
open one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But everything proves the Japanese must be
guilty,” retorted Ethel warmly.</p>

<p>“There is no direct evidence against him,” broke
in Ogden. “You know”&mdash;he stopped abruptly and
glanced about the room, then approached his wife
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>and their guests. “It strikes me as singular that
Julian Barclay is always the person to see the Jap,
Ito, and no one else ever meets him.”</p>

<p>“I have,” announced Ethel calmly.</p>

<p>“You?” Mrs. Ogden nearly dropped her coffee
cup. “When?”</p>

<p>“Where did you see him?” demanded Walter Ogden,
almost in the same breath.</p>

<p>“The night before last when Ito came to steal the
silver,” answered Ethel, and she looked challengingly
at Professor Norcross, who was following each word
with careful attention. Could she depend on him to
take his proper cue and not divulge too much? “Professor
Norcross and I both saw him,” she supplemented,
“in his flight from the house.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Norcross. “I heard Ito open the
pantry window and came down to investigate, met
Miss Ogden in the hall, and we watched Ito’s hasty
exit.”</p>

<p>“Well, upon my word!” ejaculated Mrs. Ogden.
“And I slept peacefully through all the excitement,
and this is the first I hear of your share in it, Ethel.
I must say you are not very communicative&mdash;is she,
Julian?” twisting about to include her cousin in the
conversation. Barclay, who had loitered in the dining
room to smoke his cigar, advanced farther into
the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“Not very communicative,” he responded absently.
“What were you discussing?”</p>

<p>“Cabbages,” retorted Ogden, whose temper was
getting out of hand. The fire, Patterson’s tragic
death; a sleepless night, unpropitious conditions of
the stock market, the developments at the inquest had
all had their effect on his surly disposition, and Barclay’s
urbane manner proved not only a source of
annoyance, but the last straw.</p>

<p>“Cabbages? Very good things in their line, Ogden,”
answered Barclay, with unruffled good humor.
“And possibly more profitable to cultivate than investing
in Pacific trading ships.” He turned to Norcross,
apparently oblivious of Ogden’s scowl. “I
see by the newspapers that Japan and Russia plan to
negotiate the new loan to China. Where will
American interests and American invested capital be
if the ‘Yankees of the East’ steal a march on us in
China?”</p>

<p>Norcross looked grave. “It may mean the closing
of the ‘open door’ in the Orient,” he said. “And
to think that the United States was the first to open
Japan’s eyes to the world&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The flesh, and the devil,” supplemented Barclay
skeptically. “Japan has learned the bad along with
the good, and we are wilfully blind to the situation
developing in the Far East.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“You talk like Patterson,” complained Ogden.
“Poor devil!” he added, as an afterthought. “Patterson
was as rabid on the Japanese question,
Norcross, as your friend, Carter Calhoun.”</p>

<p>Norcross caught but the mention of Calhoun’s
name. He had intercepted a look exchanged between
Ethel Ogden and Julian Barclay&mdash;a look on
Barclay’s part whose meaning bore but one interpretation,
and which had brought a touch of color to
Ethel’s white cheeks. Until that moment Ethel had
ignored Barclay’s proximity, her eyes and hands fully
occupied with a small piece of embroidery. Professor
Norcross was conscious of a growing distrust of
Julian Barclay&mdash;what made him so laggard a lover,
for that he worshiped Ethel was plain to the observant
professor, unless undesirable entanglements
prevented open courtship? Suddenly aware that his
stare at Barclay had become a glare of indignation,
Norcross roused himself.</p>

<p>“Speaking of Calhoun,” he remarked. “I hear
he is on his way to Washington.”</p>

<p>“The devil he is!” Ogden set down his coffee
cup with a bang which imperiled the Dresden china
and drew a protest from his wife. “With Calhoun
around we will never hear the end of the Japanese
question.”</p>

<p>“Is Calhoun really coming?” asked Barclay, turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
with some abruptness to Norcross. “Or is it
simply a rumor?”</p>

<p>The professor’s reply was lost as Charles announced
from the doorway: “Mr. Takasaki.”</p>

<p>The Japanese attaché appeared almost simultaneously
with the announcement of his name, and Mrs.
Ogden and her husband greeted him cordially.</p>

<p>“I came to ask for the health of you,” explained
Takasaki, bowing low over Ethel’s hand. “The fire
and the death of the honorable Mr. Patterson was of
the most dreadful.”</p>

<p>“Do sit here,” Mrs. Ogden patted the sofa, and
Takasaki bowing gravely to Barclay and Professor
Norcross, stepped past them and sat down by his
hostess. “We feel Mr. Patterson’s death awfully;
everyone does who knew him.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Patterson was a man of strong friendships,”
began Norcross.</p>

<p>“And stronger enemies,” finished Barclay, softly,
meeting the professor’s penetrating gaze for but a
moment.</p>

<p>“True,” agreed Norcross. “The Pattersons have
a quarrelsome trait. Patterson’s sister once told me
that she always kept alive her brother’s animosities.”</p>

<p>“The hateful woman!” broke in Mrs. Ogden, with
more vehemence than the occasion seemed to require,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and at her husband’s quick frown she modified
her tone. “It’s a wonder Henrietta Patterson didn’t
ruin her brother’s political career.”</p>

<p>“You knew Miss Patterson then?” asked Barclay.</p>

<p>“Yes, when visiting Ethel’s mother,” indicating
the girl, and Barclay for the first time that evening
addressed Ethel directly.</p>

<p>“Did you know Miss Patterson intimately?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“No, only slightly,” Ethel broke off her three-cornered
conversation with Takasaki and Walter
Ogden. “Miss Patterson was a recluse, and went
very little into society. She died in Paris, last
winter.”</p>

<p>Takasaki’s twinkling black eyes shot from one to
the other, and seizing the slight pause following
Ethel’s last remark, he turned to his hostess.</p>

<p>“My wife and I, we so sorry for the break-up
of your dinner the most delightful,” he began.
“We hope for your honorable presence soon with
us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden beamed with pleasure, and launched
into a brisk conversation with Takasaki in which the
other men joined. From the depths of her large
Empire chair, Ethel listened to Takasaki’s soft monotonous
voice, the deeper intonations of Barclay and
Norcross, and the heavy bass of Ogden, and a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>quality in their tones and their mannerisms impressed
her. Outwardly perfectly friendly in their intercourse,
there seemed to the listening girl, an under-current
of distrust, of watchfulness totally lacking
in past meetings between the four men. If mere
suspicion of an alien hand having killed James Patterson
could raise a barrier between the polished,
educated Japanese gentleman and American men of
his own class what would follow in the event of
racial war; a war of yellow against white? Ethel
caught her breath sharply, and drew her hand across
her eyes as if dispelling a horrible vision.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">East is East, and West is West,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And never the twain shall meet&mdash;&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The quotation flashed into her mind, and abruptly
she plunged into the conversation, only to discover
that Maru Takasaki had been patiently waiting to
bid her good night, and a trifle confused by her
absent-mindedness, she shook hands with Barclay by
mistake, attempted to laugh off her embarrassment,
and failed miserably, while acutely conscious of the
grasp of his strong, cool fingers.</p>

<p>“Good night,” he said, reluctantly releasing her
hand. “Tomorrow it will be ‘good-by.’”</p>

<p>Ethel’s fingers closed spasmodically over Takasaki’s
hand. Julian Barclay leaving&mdash;and so soon!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>During the past few hectic days she had imagined
every eventuality except that.</p>

<p>“You leave now?” questioned Takasaki, not fully
grasping Barclay’s meaning.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk your way for a block or two,” he answered.
“Anything I can do for you, Cousin Jane?”</p>

<p>“Yes, stop at the druggist and get me a book of
stamps,” Mrs. Ogden followed the two men into the
hallway, her face beaming with smiles. Barclay’s
abrupt announcement of his departure had not only
surprised but delighted her; and inwardly she hoped
that Professor Norcross would follow his example.
She was tired of entertaining guests, and she wanted
the house to herself, the better to arrange new plans
for the future. At that moment a trip to Atlantic
City was looming large on her mental horizon. In
that ocean-swept haven she could quietly wait for the
sensation caused by the murder of James Patterson
in her own house, to die out, and return in time to
enjoy the Easter season in Washington. In fact,
such a procedure would be in excellent taste, and
the canceling of her many social engagements out of
respect to the memory of James Patterson would
also be a wise move. The request for stamps was
therefore, an outcome of her thoughts; notes must
be written at once to friends and acquaintances, and
dispatched before morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“Come into the library, Ethel,” she called, after
seeing the front door close behind Takasaki and Barclay.
“Oh, I didn’t know you were just behind me,”
lowering her voice.</p>

<p>“I am on my way to bed,” explained Ethel.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mrs. Ogden’s face fell. Having once
jumped to a decision she despised putting off action.
But Ethel looked spent and weary, and reluctantly
she gave up her plans for the evening. “Run along,”
she said. “I wanted you to write letters to Mrs.
Van Alstyne and Mrs. Warner canceling my luncheon
and dinner engagements, but it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>Ethel was quick to detect the discontent in Mrs.
Ogden’s voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will write them for you,” she announced.
“It will take no time at all.”</p>

<p>“I have a better plan,” broke in Norcross who,
with Ogden, stood just behind them. “Let me write
the notes at your dictation, Mrs. Ogden, and then
your cousin can get the sleep she really needs.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with writing them yourself,
Jane?” demanded Ogden. “You never developed
pen paralysis until you found a secretary fashionable.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden turned her back on her husband. “Of
course Ethel must go to bed,” and she smiled kindly
at her. “If you will help me, Professor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“I shall be delighted”&mdash;Norcross looked back as
he followed Mrs. Ogden and her husband into the
library, to wave his hand to Ethel who responded
similarly as she went up the staircase.</p>

<p>But on reaching the next floor Ethel did not
go at once to her bedroom. Almost against her will
her feet carried her to the den, and for the third
time since the fire she went over each article left in
the room.</p>

<p>By direction of the fire chief, nothing had been
touched or moved. All furniture had been completely
or partially destroyed except her metal typewriting
desk, and after inspecting the <i>débris</i> about
her, she sat down before her desk and methodically
took out its contents. Her miniature was not
there.</p>

<p>At last Ethel sat back in her chair and closed her
eyes, endeavoring to recall each action of the day
before. No, she had not taken the miniature away;
she had put it in the top drawer of her desk just
before luncheon, and there it must have remained
until carried away by James Patterson. But what
had become of it after he had secured it? Had the
murderer picked it up in his hasty flight? Or had
Julian Barclay found and pocketed it on discovering
Patterson’s dead body? Ethel shook her head; no,
Barclay would have spoken of it&mdash;But would he?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>He had, if he found it, only gotten back his own
property.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon!” said a voice from the doorway,
and Ethel started violently. “Miss Ogden, is it
not?” Ethel looked at the well-dressed man in the
doorway and nodded. “I did not mean to startle
you, Miss Ogden. I have been watching you for several
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Ethel flushed with indignation.</p>

<p>“I thought you saw me,” hastily. “I am Mitchell,
from the central office,” displaying his badge. “Have
you found any trace of your miniature?”</p>

<p>“No,” Ethel mollified by the detective’s gentlemanly
appearance and quiet manner, looked eagerly
toward him. “Have you searched for it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I can’t find it high or low,” admitted
Mitchell. He came closer to her. “I believe the
man who has that miniature killed Patterson.”</p>

<p>Ethel recoiled. “No!” she declared vehemently,
and Mitchell looked at her oddly. “It must be somewhere
around, dropped in some crevice or crack.”
She bent over the wreck of a chair and fumbled
about, more anxious to conceal her expression from
Mitchell’s inquiring gaze than in the hopes of finding
anything.</p>

<p>“Charles, the butler, has just admitted that before
the fire chief gave orders to have everything left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>just as it was, he carried some of the <i>débris</i> down
into the basement,” volunteered Mitchell. “It’s just
possible your miniature may be in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let us go and see,” Ethel sprang impulsively
for the door and collided with Professor Norcross.
“Excuse me!”</p>

<p>“It was my fault,” Norcross laughed as he helped
her regain her balance, then his eyes lighted on the
detective. “Charles brought me word that you
wished to see me, Mitchell.”</p>

<p>“I did, sir.” Mitchell stepped out into the hall.
“I called to ask if you have a revolver.”</p>

<p>“I have,” responded Norcross, and turned at the
sound of footsteps, and a second later Barclay joined
the small group.</p>

<p>“Asking for revolvers, Mitchell?” he inquired
coolly. “I have one,” and simultaneously the two
men went to their respective rooms, leaving Ethel
staring in troubled silence at the detective.</p>

<p>Before she could ask the question Mitchell felt
coming, Norcross was back, revolver in hand.
Mitchell took it, examined it critically, selected a
shell from its breech, snapped it shut and returned
it to Norcross just as Barclay rejoined them. His
revolver was likewise subjected to a prolonged examination,
and a cartridge extracted, marked, and
slipped into the detective’s pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Mitchell, handing the revolver
back to Barclay. “That is all I wished, I won’t detain
you longer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait.” Ethel without a glance at Norcross
and Barclay, followed Mitchell down the back hall.
“Let us go and examine the <i>débris</i> which you said
was downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” and Mitchell made way for her to
precede him. In the basement they found Charles
just closing the house.</p>

<p>“The <i>débris</i>, is it?” he exclaimed on Mitchell
stating what they wished. “Sure, it’s all here,” and
Ethel, regardless of her white gown, dropped on
her knees beside the bucket of trash and ashes.
Dumping the pail on a newspaper spread out by the
attentive Charles, Ethel ran her fingers through the
mass, but without results&mdash;there was no trace of her
miniature.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” Mitchell, searching with her,
pulled out a piece of white flannel, and rising examined
the dark stains on it under the light. Suddenly
he raised the flannel and sniffed at it.</p>

<p>“Powder stains,” he exclaimed, thrusting the oily,
dirty cloth under Ethel’s nose. “Where did you
get this piece of flannel, Charles?” as the butler returned
from a trip to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Oh, that?” inspecting the flannel. “Sure, Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>Julian Barclay used that to clean his revolver this
mornin’&mdash;you wouldn’t be wantin’ me to leave a
dhirty bit like that in his room, Miss Ethel, would
ye?” turning to her.</p>

<p>But Ethel had fled.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was barely nine o’clock in the morning when
Leonard McLane reached his office in response
to an urgent telephone call, and the one occupant of
his office rose to greet him with marked impatience,
which he vainly tried to conceal under cordiality.</p>

<p>“It was good of you to hurry down,” said Colonel
Carter Calhoun following him into his private office.
“I was sorry to cut short your breakfast hour.”</p>

<p>“That was all right,” responded McLane, pushing
a chair up to his desk. “You rang off before I could
ask you to breakfast with me, Colonel.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Calhoun dragged his chair forward,
close to McLane. “I went at once from the Union
Station to see the Secretary of War and while breakfasting
with him, telephoned you from his residence.
I want to thank you for wiring me of Dwight Tilghman’s
murder&mdash;it was a shock, a very great shock&mdash;and
now to be met with the news of James Patterson’s
murder,” Calhoun sighed. “It looks badly,
very badly&mdash;and no trace of the murderer.”</p>

<p>“I see you use the singular tense,” commented McLane.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
“You believe, then, Colonel, that one man
committed the two crimes?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to reserve my theories until I’ve heard
your facts.” And McLane smiled covertly at his
caution.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the morning newspaper and its
account of the Patterson inquest?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Does it not seem possible that James Patterson,
blinded by the smoke from the burning room, unexpectedly
encountered this Yoshida Ito, who might
have been in the Ogden house only to steal, and
instead killed Patterson, an outspoken enemy of his
country, and escaped unseen in the smoke and confusion?”
asked McLane thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“That did occur to me,” acknowledged Calhoun.
“And your theory is borne out by the loss of the
miniature, which I see in the newspaper article is
reported mysteriously missing. Patterson may have
taken it from the burning room and dropped it on
meeting the Jap, who may have stolen it after killing
him.” Calhoun pursed up his lips and looked meditatively
at McLane. “It strikes me that Miss Ogden
must have attached unusual importance to that miniature
to have asked a man to risk his life to get it for
her out of a burning room. Was it a particularly
fine work of art?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know; I’ve never seen it.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” muttered Calhoun. “Is Miss Ethel
Ogden closely related to Walter Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Third or fourth cousin, I believe,” McLane
moved restlessly; he was not pleasantly impressed
with Carter Calhoun. “Miss Ogden is a charming,
lovable girl, the soul of honor,” he added warmly.</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed; I hope to meet her soon,” Calhoun
settled himself more comfortably in his chair. “Professor
Norcross, you’ve met him of course, has been
kind enough to keep me informed of several matters
relating to Tilghman’s death, and wrote me that she
was very beautiful. Who’s in your front office?” he
added, with some abruptness, and McLane stared at
his keen hearing; he himself had not detected footsteps
in the next room.</p>

<p>“I imagine it is Dr. Horace Shively,” he said, rising
hurriedly. “He was to call here about this
time”&mdash;stopping with his hand on the doorknob.
“He was on the train when Tilghman was murdered
and first detected the use of oxalic acid.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Do you know him well?”</p>

<p>“No, only slightly. He had a good practice in
Newport, but ill health forced him to retire, and
having a comfortable fortune he spends much of his
time traveling.” Turning back to the door McLane
opened it, and found his expected visitor standing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>with his back to him looking out of the window.
“How are you, Doctor?” he exclaimed cordially, and
Shively wheeled about. “Come into my private
office,” added McLane, after they had shaken hands;
“Colonel Calhoun is anxious to meet you, we were
discussing Tilghman’s murder while waiting for
you.” And he stepped aside to let Shively pass him.</p>

<p>Calhoun rose on their entrance and bowed gravely
to Shively as McLane introduced them. “Take my
seat,” he said, and dropped into another chair and
sat with his back to the light. “I have traveled east,
Dr. Shively, to secure data about the murder of my
friend, Dwight Tilghman.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I am here,” answered Shively, tilting
back in his chair to make room for McLane to reach
his desk. “I wanted to come before, but was detained
by business; however I’ve sifted out the
evidence extracted at the inquest at Atlanta.”</p>

<p>“And your conclusions?” demanded Calhoun.</p>

<p>“I at first thought the Japanese, Ito, guilty, but
now I believe a fellow traveler, Julian Barclay, poisoned
Tilghman,” responded Shively.</p>

<p>“Julian Barclay? Humph!” Calhoun clasped
and unclasped his long, strong fingers. “He was
mentioned in the newspapers as having been the first
to find Jim Patterson’s dead body&mdash;and now you
say you suspect him of having some connection with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>Tilghman’s murder. Humph!” McLane, who had
started at the mention of Julian Barclay’s name, sat
silent, studying the men, and debated in his own mind
how much and how little he should tell them.</p>

<p>“Your reasons, Dr. Shively, for thinking Barclay
guilty of poisoning Tilghman,” demanded Calhoun,
breaking his silence.</p>

<p>“I have been in communication with a porter who
has made out a sworn statement of having seen
Julian Barclay leave the train and go toward the
station entrance, and then bolt suddenly back into his
Pullman car, with every indication of a desire to
conceal himself. I have also found out through the
Pinkertons’, whom I employed, that none of the few
passengers traveling north in Barclay’s Pullman remained
in that car while the train was in the Atlanta
station.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Then Barclay had the car to himself,”
Calhoun stared at Shively. “And unobserved he
could do as he wished without fear of detection.”</p>

<p>“And also, let me state just here, that if innocent,
Barclay could not prove an alibi if no passengers were
in his car while the train was in Atlanta,” interposed
McLane.</p>

<p>“He gave no alibi in his deposition,” retorted
Shively. “That first directed my suspicion toward
him. He must have committed the crime immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
on his return to the train, for Norcross and I
got back from eating a light lunch in the station and
stood in the vestibule of the smoking car until just
before the train started, when we went back to our
own section for a brief stay. And the conductor was
standing in the vestibule of the car when we left it,”
he added.</p>

<p>“With you and Norcross there and later the conductor
it would have been impossible for a criminal
to sneak on board your end of the smoking
car,” commented Calhoun. “But a car has two entrances&mdash;what
about the other?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the porter was there.”</p>

<p>“Sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I saw him standing on the lower step of
the forward vestibule; anyone passing into the
smoker from that end would have attracted his attention,
and railroad officials assured me they could
place reliance on the porter’s word and efficiency.”</p>

<p>McLane started to speak, then thinking better of
it, sat silent contemplating his two companions.</p>

<p>“Did you hear no sound inside the car?” asked
Calhoun.</p>

<p>“No. Norcross was telling me of a trip to South
America as I sat below him on the step of the vestibule.
We neither of us heard a sound from the
interior of the car.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“By sound, I mean a cry for help, or raised voices
quarreling,” persisted Calhoun, looking directly at
Shively.</p>

<p>“I heard none,” declared Shively positively. “And
I am sure we would have heard had Tilghman been
quarreling with anyone, for most of the windows
were raised and screened.”</p>

<p>“But the noises of a railroad station might have
drowned even raised voices,” objected McLane.</p>

<p>“I think not,” Shively pulled his chair nearer.
“Norcross and I conversed in our ordinary tones,
and heard each other without difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Then with you and Norcross at one vestibule and
the porter at the other, and no sound from the interior
of the car, I think it can safely be assumed that
Tilghman was poisoned between the time the train
first pulled into the Atlanta station and your return
to the smoking car from your luncheon, Shively,”
argued McLane. “How long a time elapsed while
you were at luncheon?”</p>

<p>“Let me see&mdash;about twenty-five minutes, I
imagine.”</p>

<p>“And how long was the train detained at Atlanta?”</p>

<p>“Two hours; but passengers commenced returning
fully half an hour before the train started north,”
Shively paused. “The mystery surrounding this
crime has had a powerful attraction for me, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>have of my own volition employed Pinkerton detectives.
They report that the hunt has narrowed
down to two men&mdash;Yoshida Ito and Julian Barclay.”</p>

<p>“What is the evidence against the Jap, Ito?” asked
McLane.</p>

<p>“Sifted down it amounts to little,” admitted Shively slowly.
“Ito and Tilghman had a fisticuff shortly
before we reached Atlanta; Tilghman compared the
Jap to a yellow negro; and Ito on being questioned
after the discovery of the crime, gave as his alibi that
he was at the public library in Atlanta at the time the
crime was committed. However, the hour’s difference
in central and eastern time nullifies that alibi&mdash;he
may have committed the crime and still have been
at the library.”</p>

<p>“Then the chief evidence against the Jap is the
question of time,” said McLane with growing impatience.
“You also contend that Ito took offense at
an implied insult given thirty or forty minutes before
the train reached Atlanta. Now, I myself do not
believe that crime was ever committed on impulse.
It was too well planned and devilish in its ingenuity.”</p>

<p>“That is no argument against a Japanese having
been the criminal,” said Calhoun dryly. “They are
the most silent, relentless people in the world. To
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>me the plot smacks of the East, and is more far
reaching than we yet imagine, and embraces the
murder of James Patterson.”</p>

<p>“What!” ejaculated Shively. “You think the two
crimes have a bearing on each other?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me,” muttered Shively, looking
dazed. “I saw Patterson in the Atlanta station for
a second on my way to the lunchroom. He told Norcross
and me that he had decided to take the midnight
express to Washington as that would give him several
hours more in Atlanta, and he would reach Washington
but a few hours later than if he took the train
we were on.”</p>

<p>McLane sat forward in his chair. “Did Patterson
by chance encounter Julian Barclay in the station?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell you,” replied Shively.</p>

<p>“It was more than coincidence which brought
Tilghman, Ito, James Patterson, and Julian Barclay
together, perhaps unknown to each other, in that
station,&mdash;it was Fate,” said Calhoun solemnly. “In
sifting out one crime we will clear up both.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! Tilghman’s death is mysterious enough
without having another murder hinging on it,”
exclaimed Shively impatiently. “There is one interesting
point which has not been brought out. Tilghman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
after his scuffle with the Jap, borrowed a flask
from Julian Barclay.”</p>

<p>McLane’s hand closed with some force over his
chair arm. “How did you make that discovery?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“The brakeman who passed through the smoker
just after the scuffle, saw Barclay hand a flask to
Tilghman. Unfortunately the man was hurt in an
accident, and did not appear at the inquest,” Shively
paused, then resumed more quietly. “I sent Barclay
back to the empty smoker after removing Tilghman’s
body, and he thus had ample opportunity to
recover his flask and remove all trace of his crime.”</p>

<p>“But what motive had he in poisoning Tilghman?”
demanded McLane excitedly.</p>

<p>“The loss of a large sum of money to Tilghman
during a game of cards the night before the murder.”</p>

<p>Calhoun shook his head. “No, too thin,” he said
curtly. “A deeper motive than that lies behind the
murder. Tilghman was coming to Washington on a
special mission, and he had with him valuable state
documents, and their possession cost him his life.”</p>

<p>“I examined Tilghman’s personal effects and luggage,”
exclaimed Shively in bewilderment. “And I
found no sign of their having been disturbed or
searched, nor did I see any valuable papers.”</p>

<p>Calhoun smiled enigmatically. “Did you not?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>Then the murderer must have secured the documents
and left no trace of having done so. The loss of
these documents may do the United States irreparable
harm, may, in fact, precipitate war between
this country and&mdash;Japan.”</p>

<p>“Then in Heaven’s name, let us find the Jap, Ito,”
cried McLane, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>“Finding Julian Barclay would lead to the same
result,” protested Shively. “They are in collusion.”</p>

<p>Calhoun looked at him oddly. “Not a bad idea,”
he said, rising. “I must be going, McLane; I have
to see Chief Connor of the Secret Service. Where
are you stopping, Doctor?” turning to Shively, who
had also risen.</p>

<p>“At the New Willard,” Shively extended his hand,
and Calhoun’s strong clasp made his fingers tingle.</p>

<p>“One more question, Doctor, before I go,” as he
spoke Calhoun turned back from the door held open
by McLane. “Do you recall whether the shade of
the window by which Tilghman sat was pulled
down?”</p>

<p>“It was.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” and Calhoun joined McLane in the
corridor.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STILL, SMALL VOICE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">C</span>harles</span>, the butler, stared in dismay at the
untasted breakfast sitting temptingly before
Walter Ogden. Not a dish had been touched, and
twenty minutes had elapsed since he brought them in,
hot from the kitchen. The perturbed butler took a
hesitating step toward Ogden but a glimpse of his
face behind the morning paper, and its forbidding
expression caused Charles to retreat on tip-toe, his
warning about a cold breakfast unspoken. Once
before he had incautiously interrupted Ogden at just
such a moment, and had fled before the storm provoked
by his temerity.</p>

<p>Charles had left the room but a bare five minutes
when Ogden threw down his newspaper, poured out
a cup of coffee, drank it almost in one gulp, and
leaving his breakfast uneaten, walked heavily away
from the table. His destination was his wife’s bedroom,
and he found her sitting before the mahogany
dressing table arranging her hair, with an absorption
as to detail which admitted no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t be very long,” exclaimed Mrs. Ogden,
catching sight of her husband’s reflection in the mirror.
“Go down and get your breakfast; don’t wait
for me,&mdash;I can’t be any quicker than I can.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden could not break herself of the last
phrase; it was invariably a red rag to her husband,
whose impatient disposition chafed at being kept
waiting, even for an infinitesimal second. He did
not retreat as Mrs. Ogden hoped he would, but instead
advanced into the bedroom.</p>

<p>“Send your maid away,” he directed, scowling at
the pretty French woman, and Mrs. Ogden with a
resigned expression directed Celeste to wait in her
own room until she rang for her. When the door
had closed behind the maid, Ogden jerked a chair
forward and planted it by the dressing table.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the papers?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The papers?” repeated Mrs. Ogden. “I haven’t
had time to read them; well, you needn’t be provoked,”
offended by Ogden’s impatient snort. “It’s
your own fault; if you didn’t insist on my breakfasting
downstairs, I could read the papers in bed.”</p>

<p>“Here is the <i>Post</i>,” Ogden thrust the newspaper
into her hand. “Read this account of the inquest,”
and at the word “inquest” his wife seized the paper
with avidity, but her reading of the article was delayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
by a search for her eyeglasses which had misplaced
themselves, according to Mrs. Ogden. Thoroughly
exasperated, Ogden tumbled the puffs and
hairpins about the dressing table until he drew a
wail from Mrs. Ogden, who had finally discovered
the missing glasses under her pillow. But the lure
of the newspaper averted any lengthened argument,
and Mrs. Ogden read the entire article before her
husband again addressed her.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” he asked as she lowered
the paper.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly what to think,” she answered.
“I wish I had been permitted to sit in the
courtroom and listen to the other witnesses testify.”</p>

<p>“That is neither here nor there,” interrupted Ogden,
rudely. “Have you seen this miniature of which
Ethel speaks?”</p>

<p>“No, never,” Mrs. Ogden reread a paragraph in
the paper. “Strange she never showed it to me!”</p>

<p>“And the ring”&mdash;Ogden rumpled his heavy white
hair until it stood upright. “Was the ring given to
her by James Patterson or Julian Barclay?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” Ogden rose abruptly, “it’s time
you found out what is taking place in this house,”
and he banged out of the room before his astonished
wife could question his meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden contemplated her reflection in the
mirror in indecision; she was more perturbed than
she cared to admit even to herself. Completing her
dressing with no sign of haste, she summoned her
maid and ordered her breakfast served in her bedroom,
and between dainty bites of hot toast and
marmalade again read the newspaper account of the
inquest; but she did not linger over the particular
paragraphs which had so excited her husband, instead
concentrating her attention on Julian Barclay’s
testimony. At last throwing the paper aside, she
wrote out the <i>menu</i> for the day, the orders for the
grocer and the market man, and dispatched them to
her cook by Celeste, and with the relief occasioned
by having completed her morning’s work, she went
in search of Ethel.</p>

<p>A faint “Come in” answered Mrs. Ogden’s determined
rap on Ethel’s bedroom door, but she
stopped abruptly just over the threshold on beholding
the room in darkness.</p>

<p>“Bless me! Why don’t you pull up the shades,
Ethel?” she asked. “Do you know it’s nearly
noon?” And not waiting for a reply, she hurried
across the room and pushed aside the blinds. “Brr!
every window open!” she ejaculated, shivering.
“And the steam heat turned off. Ethel, you are incorrigible!
Do you want to have pneumonia?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“No such luck!” muttered Ethel, and Mrs. Ogden,
busily turning on the cock of the steam radiator
missed the remark. “Do you want me for anything,
Cousin Jane?” throwing back the bedcovers as she
spoke.</p>

<p>“Just to chat with you,” Mrs. Ogden ensconced
herself in a big chair, first taking the precaution to
slip on Ethel’s sweater which lay on a near-by sofa.
“My goodness, Ethel, I don’t believe you slept a
wink last night!” getting a good look at her as she
moved toward her bureau.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t sleep,” acknowledged Ethel. “That is
why I stayed in bed this morning.” She paused to
gather up her underclothes and returned to her bed,
on which she perched. “Nothing exciting has occurred, has
there?”</p>

<p>In spite of Ethel’s effort to keep her voice indifferent, a
trained ear would have caught the undertone of
pent-up anxiety and fear; a fear of herself,
of Julian Barclay, and of Detective Mitchell, which
had kept her a prisoner in her room. Her night had
been a night of horrors. Her faith in Julian Barclay
had been shaken to its foundations by the discovery
of the powder-stained flannel and Charles’ unintentionally
incriminating remark&mdash;Julian Barclay had
occasion to clean his revolver the morning after
James Patterson had been murdered by a shot from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>a revolver; and Barclay had surrendered that self-same
revolver to the detective cleaned and each
chamber containing a loaded cartridge.</p>

<p>“Coincidences,” Ethel had told herself. “All coincidences,”
but the mere word brought little comfort
as she twisted and turned on her pillow. Detective
Mitchell did not look like a man who would
place confidence in coincidences; and Ethel, toward
daylight, had fallen into fitful slumber, in which
dreams of Julian Barclay, handcuffed, standing in the
prisoner’s pen while she, Ethel, testified against him,
haunted her. The nightmare had seemed so realistic
that she awoke cold with fright, but with one
resolve firmly taken; for weal or for woe she would
befriend Julian Barclay; and until he, himself, confessed
his guilt she would believe him innocent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden’s sudden descent on her bedroom had
aroused her dormant fear of Mitchell; had he acted
precipitously after his discovery of the powder-stained
flannel, and had Mrs. Ogden appeared to
break the news of Julian Barclay’s arrest to
her?</p>

<p>“No more excitements here, thank Heaven!” exclaimed
Mrs. Ogden, having taken her time to make
herself comfortable. “My nervous system won’t
stand any more cyclonic outbreaks. I’ve been spending
the morning reading accounts of the inquest;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>here, glance at the <i>Post</i>,” flinging the newspaper
across the bed, and Ethel, but half dressed, perused
the article with feverish haste, and she, like Mrs.
Ogden, lingered longest over Julian Barclay’s testimony.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of it?” asked Mrs.
Ogden finally, unconsciously repeating her husband’s
question to her earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the Japanese, Yoshida Ito, and
James Patterson were discussing,” replied Ethel, laying
down the paper and resuming her dressing.</p>

<p>“You think they met?”</p>

<p>“Julian Barclay states so, according to this article,”
and Ethel glanced curiously at the older
woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden shrugged her shoulders. “As Ito is
still a fugitive from justice and poor Jim dead, we
are not likely to know what they talked about, nor
can Julian’s statement of the meeting be confirmed.”</p>

<p>“You doubt Julian’s testimony?” and Mrs. Ogden
had the grace to blush under Ethel’s scorn. “You,
his own cousin?”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” she began, moving uneasily.
“Julian has sometimes, eh, prevaricated. I remember as
a boy he used to tell the most abominable
stories to get out of going to church, and I&mdash;I&mdash;have
reason to fear the habit’s grown on him,&mdash;of prevarication,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
I mean,” she added confusedly. “Have you
ever caught him in an, eh, evasion?”</p>

<p>It was the one thing in which Ethel had caught
Barclay in, and she winced at the question. “Oh,
pshaw! what is an evasion?” she asked with assumed
lightness. “We are all guilty of it, and you
remember the boy who said ‘a lie is an abomination
of the Lord, but a very present help in time of
trouble’.”</p>

<p>Instead of smiling, Mrs. Ogden sighed. “Some
people attract trouble,” she said gloomily. “Julian
is one of them.”</p>

<p>Ethel selected a silk waist from the bureau drawer
with care. “Has Julian spent many years in the
Far East?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how long he was out there,” answered
Mrs. Ogden. “We haven’t met for years
until this winter. Julian has traveled ever since the
death of Cousin Julian Barclay, senior&mdash;he adopted
him, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t aware of it,” Ethel dressed more
slowly; she had tried before, but unsuccessfully, to
get Mrs. Ogden to discuss Julian Barclay, and she
was determined to learn something of him now that
Mrs. Ogden was at last in a communicative mood.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cousin Julian left him all his money as well
as his name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>“Then Julian’s father was&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“William, Cousin William,” Mrs. Ogden added
quickly. “Both Julian’s parents died while he was
young, and he was brought up by Cousin Julian, the
most eccentric, cantankerous old wretch!” Mrs. Ogden
paused breathlessly. “No one grieved when he
died, and his will just about saved young Julian from&mdash;What
do you want, Celeste?” she asked abruptly
as the Frenchwoman appeared.</p>

<p>“Mrs. McLane is downstairs, Madame.”</p>

<p>Ethel paused, conscious-smitten. “Oh, I asked
Lois to lunch with me, thinking you were going to
the Van Alstynes’ today, Cousin Jane, and I never
thought of it again until this minute.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you did, I like Lois McLane,” answered
Mrs. Ogden. “Ask her to come upstairs to
Miss Ethel’s room, Celeste.” She waited until the
maid had disappeared, then turned to Ethel. “What
about this miniature business? You never told me
you had one of yourself.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;meant to,” stammered Ethel, taken by surprise.
“I will some day.”</p>

<p>“Who made it?” Mrs. Ogden was not to be
put off.</p>

<p>“The artist? I don’t recall his name,” Ethel
brushed a stray curl into place. “The miniature was
a&mdash;a surprise to me, Cousin Jane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! Jim Patterson was always doing the
unexpected,” Mrs. Ogden, deterred by Ethel’s manner
from too close questioning, was trying by indirect
means to elicit information. “Did he give you
the ring, too?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ogden left her chair and faced Ethel. “Did
Julian Barclay give you the ring?” she demanded,
looking straight at her, but evasion was far from
Ethel’s mind.</p>

<p>“He did,” she said simply. Her eyes, however,
told more than she knew, and Mrs. Ogden suddenly
saw her through a mist of tears.</p>

<p>“What have I done?” she stammered, laying her
hand almost imploringly on the girl’s shoulder. “God
forgive me for ever asking Julian Barclay here!”
and turning she stumbled blindly from the room, and
passing Lois McLane in the hall without a word of
greeting, made her way into her bedroom and flung
herself on her lounge.</p>

<p>Lois stopped to look after Mrs. Ogden in bewilderment;
it was the first time she had known her to
be guilty of rudeness; then she continued more slowly
to Ethel’s bedroom.</p>

<p>Ethel was still standing where Mrs. Ogden had
left her, and her face lighted with relief at sight of
Lois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“I’m so glad you’ve come,” she said, clinging to
Lois as they embraced. “I am frightened, Lois,
frightened,” and a sob broke from her.</p>

<p>Lois’ arms closed about her lovingly. “Come and
tell me all about it,” she coaxed; and Ethel, her
natural reserve giving way to her longing for comfort
and help, poured her hopes and fears into Lois’
sympathetic ears.</p>

<p>“Let me understand clearly, Ethel, the reasons
you have for thinking Julian guilty of Dwight Tilghman’s
death?” Lois’ expression had grown graver
and graver as Ethel’s account had progressed.
“They were both from California; both on the same
train; they played cards the night before the murder
and Julian lost a large sum of money to Dwight
which was strangely missing after his death; Dwight
remained alone in the smoker while the train was in
Atlanta and was there poisoned. Julian, among the
men who might have poisoned Dwight, is the only
one who cannot give an alibi; and your mother passing
along the train-shed, saw a hand wearing a
peculiar ring, holding a small paper aloft in a suspicious
position, and this ring&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Is here,” springing to her feet Ethel took the
ring and a letter from her bureau drawer. “See,
they are identical,” spreading out the sketch of the
hand sent by her mother. “And appearances lead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>me to believe that Julian gave me the ring that it
might not be found in his possession&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Because it might be incriminating evidence?”
finished Lois. “Do you not think it just possible that
Julian gave it to you because he wanted you to have
something of his?” Ethel flushed and glanced up
eagerly, hopefully. “Have you other reasons for
thinking Julian connected with Dwight’s death?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ethel hesitated; then plunged ahead with
her story. “The night I saw Ito dash out of the
house with Julian in pursuit of him, I heard Julian
call to Ito in a guarded voice, ‘Ito, I have no more
money to spare.’” Ethel paused again. “It may
be that this Ito may have seen Julian poison Dwight
Tilghman and be blackmailing him.”</p>

<p>Lois looked at her pityingly. “It may be,” she
repeated mechanically. “I&mdash;” A discreet knock on
the door interrupted her.</p>

<p>“The mail, Miss Ethel,” announced Charles from
the hall, and Ethel hastened over to the door, returning
to Lois an instant later with a letter.</p>

<p>“Go on, Lois, I am listening,” she urged, tearing
open the envelope. “What is this?” her voice changing
as her eyes fell on a torn and ragged photograph.</p>

<p>It was the upper half of a man’s face, and as
Ethel studied the fine eyes, wavy black hair and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>straight nose, an exclamation escaped her. “Why it
might be Julian, taken years ago, before his hair
turned gray at the temples.”</p>

<p>Lois looked at the photograph attentively, then
sat bolt upright. “I’ve seen that before,” she announced
excitedly. “Jim Patterson received it during
the dinner just before the fire; and in opening
the envelope the picture fell into my lap, face uppermost,
and but that he wore a beard in the photograph
I should have known instantly that it was Julian
Barclay.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Ethel stared perplexedly at the torn
photograph and then examined the envelope. “Why
should this scrap have been sent to me? There is
no name on the envelope, no card or message, and
the address is typewritten.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” Lois rubbed her hands excitedly
together. “Jim said that he had ordered the letter
forwarded to him as it was important.”</p>

<p>“Did Julian see Jim receive the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the picture as well; for he caught the
photograph as it slid out of my lap.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Ethel covered her face, then dropped her
hand disclosing such misery that Lois cried out.
“Hush! Lois, before dinner, I found Julian and
Jim quarreling, and Jim threatened to expose Julian&mdash;for
what I don’t know. Perhaps this photograph
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>had something to do with the exposure&mdash;it was evidently
taken years ago.”</p>

<p>“True. And Julian saw the photograph, saw exposure
imminent and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shot Jim,” completed Ethel, with forced calmness.
“So I reasoned it out last night. I did not
then know of the existence of this photograph, but I
knew of the quarrel, Jim’s threat of exposure, and
that Julian cleaned his revolver the morning after
the murder.”</p>

<p>Lois’ eyes opened to their widest. “Heaven!” she
exclaimed aghast. “And Julian Barclay was the first
to find Jim Patterson. My husband saw him bending
over his dead body&mdash;and no one else was in
the vicinity.”</p>

<p>“It all dovetails,” admitted Ethel, and her eyes
were indescribably sad. “What more likely than that
Julian took his revolver intending to use it in the
capture of the Jap, Ito; met Jim unexpectedly, and
under cover of the smoke and fusillade of shots,
which drowned his, gave way to temptation and
killed Jim.”</p>

<p>“It is too horrible!” Lois’ gesture was eloquent.
“And yet jealous men have committed crime since the
days of Cain, and, God knows, Julian had reason
to hate Jim Patterson”&mdash;she hesitated, but one look
at Ethel decided her, and the information she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>come that day to give her remained unspoken.
“Ethel, dear”&mdash;impulsively she clasped her hands.
“What can I say to you? How comfort you?”</p>

<p>Ethel tightened her grip of Lois’ hands, then
dropped them slowly. “I told you I reasoned out
all the evidence against Julian&mdash;I did not say I
<i>believed</i> Julian a murderer.”</p>

<p>“Ethel!” Lois’ eyes were shining. “I pray God
that your loyalty and faith are not misplaced.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence as Ethel, with shaking
fingers, completed her toilet, but her interview with
Lois had strengthened her; she had lost the feeling
of being alone and helpless; she knew that she could
depend on Lois in any crisis.</p>

<p>“We had better go downstairs?” she suggested.
“The household is so disorganized that I don’t know
whether Charles will think to send us word when
luncheon is ready.” She paused long enough to replace
Barclay’s ring, the sketch, and the photograph
in her bureau and take the drawer key, then accompanied
Lois downstairs.</p>

<p>Ogden was standing in the large entrance hall,
and he greeted their appearance with a grunt of
approval.</p>

<p>“Your Cousin Jane has a very ill-regulated appetite,”
he said, after shaking hands with Lois. “She
never knows when it’s time for luncheon or dinner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>Have you seen her this morning, Ethel?” and a
penetrating look, of which his cousin was totally unaware,
accompanied the question.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ethel. “Cousin Jane came into
my room for a few minutes this morning.”</p>

<p>“Any idea where she is now?”</p>

<p>“No; but I can look for her,” and Ethel slipped
into the drawing room, only to find Professor Norcross
the sole occupant of it.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me disturb you,” she exclaimed, as he
dropped his newspaper on seeing her. “I’m looking
for Mrs. Ogden to tell her that luncheon is
ready.”</p>

<p>“Let me find her for you&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“No, don’t trouble.” But Norcross stepped after
her into the hall. “I imagine Cousin Jane is in the
library,” and leaving the professor greeting Lois
McLane and Walter Ogden, she entered the library.
Her sudden entrance caused a man standing at the
farther end of the room to dart unseen behind a tall
screen.</p>

<p>Ethel reached the center of the large library before
she became aware that Julian Barclay, and not
Mrs. Ogden, was stretched on the large leather sofa,
sound asleep. Ethel drew back, intending flight, but
an overwhelming desire to see Barclay, to study his
expression as he lay asleep, mastered her, and step
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>by step she crept nearer until she stood at the head
of the sofa, looking down at him.</p>

<p>Barclay showed the effect of sleepless nights. His
eyes seemed more sunken, or the shadows under his
eyelashes gave them that appearance, while deeper
lines about his mouth and a graying of the black
hair over the temples were indelible marks of strain
and suffering. His dreams did not seem to be of
the pleasantest, judging by the restless movement of
his head, and the twitching of his hands.</p>

<p>Out in the hall Ogden waited with unconcealed
impatience for his other guests and his wife to assemble
for luncheon. Nor had Charles put in an
appearance, although he had repeatedly rung the
bell. Finally Lois could stand his nervous, almost
furtive glances about the hall no longer.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and see what’s keeping Ethel,” she volunteered,
edging toward the library door.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty how-de-do if one guest has to seek
another,” grumbled Ogden. “Go with her, Norcross,
and see she doesn’t vamoose the way Ethel
appears to have done.”</p>

<p>Norcross laughed as he crossed the hall and pulled
back the portières, but both he and Lois stopped
short just over the threshold at sight of the tableau
confronting them in the sun-flooded room.</p>

<p>Ethel, love and a great compassion lighting her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>face, was stooping over Julian Barclay, who lay apparently
asleep on the sofa. Suddenly Barclay tossed
his hand above his head and his fingers touched
Ethel’s cool palm resting on his pillow. The contact
evidently fitted into his dream, for he smiled
contentedly as his grasp tightened on her hand.</p>

<p>“Ethel!” he called, and as she bent further over
him, his smile faded into a frown, the lines in his
face deepened, and he writhed as if in pain, his lips
moving, but at first no words came.</p>

<p>“God help me!” he groaned. “I killed Patterson.”</p>

<p>A scream, terrible in its agony, broke from Ethel
and awoke Barclay from his slumbers and Lois and
Norcross from their stupor. It was the professor
who caught Ethel as she reeled backward, and assisted
her to a chair.</p>

<p>Barclay, but half awake, sat staring in growing
horror at the handcuffs dangling from his wrists,
while Detective Mitchell, who had slipped from behind
a screen some seconds before, gazed with satisfaction
at his prisoner.</p>

<p>“I already had evidence enough to secure this warrant,”
he said, producing the document. “But I’m
obliged to you, Mr. Barclay, for calling out that you
killed Patterson&mdash;and before witnesses, too.”</p>

<p>Barclay’s gaze roved around the little group,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>lingering longest on Ethel, who sat with her face
buried in her hands, and his expression brought stinging
tears to Lois’ eyes.</p>

<p>“Did I talk in my sleep?” he questioned, with dry
lips.</p>

<p>Lois nodded, speech was impossible for her.
Mitchell broke the painful silence.</p>

<p>“You said: ‘God help me, I killed Patterson’,”
he announced.</p>

<p>Barclay rose stiffly, and the jingle of the handcuffs
caused Ethel to look at him. He moved like
an old man.</p>

<p>“Well, so I did kill Patterson,” he admitted
slowly. “But not James Patterson.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CONFESSION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ulian Barclay’s</span> confession staggered his
hearers, who gazed at him in amazement too
great for words.</p>

<p>“I don’t get your meaning,” stammered Mitchell.
“Explain yourself.”</p>

<p>Before Barclay could comply with his request, the
portières were dragged aside and Walter Ogden
strode into the room. He came to an abrupt stop
as his eyes lighted on Barclay standing handcuffed,
the central figure of the little group. Ogden
hardly seemed aware of the others, his gaze being
focused on Barclay and the handcuffs. Great beads
of perspiration appeared on his forehead.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he demanded.
“What deviltry are you up to?” and he glared at
them all.</p>

<p>Mitchell took the question to himself, and an angry
sparkle lit his eyes. “Don’t interfere with the administration
of the law,” he snapped. “I’ve just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>arrested your cousin, Mr. Julian Barclay, for the
murder of James Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Of which I am entirely innocent,” declared Barclay,
facing the detective with something of his
habitual poise and self-command.</p>

<p>“That remains to be proved,” exclaimed Mitchell
skeptically. “I am still awaiting an explanation of
your cryptic remark that you killed Patterson and
not James Patterson.”</p>

<p>Barclay cleared his throat, and not looking at
Ethel, addressed them inclusively.</p>

<p>“Fifteen years ago I accidently shot and killed Dr.
Paul Patterson, with whom I roomed in Baltimore
while a student at Johns Hopkins University,” he
said. “I was acquitted by the grand jury.”</p>

<p>“After three trials.” The comment slipped from
Walter Ogden, and too late, he regretted the words.</p>

<p>“After three trials,” repeated Barclay slowly.
“Quite true, but I was acquitted, and cannot be tried
again for that offense.”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall any such case,” muttered Mitchell.
“How did you come to kill this Paul Patterson?”</p>

<p>Barclay did not reply at once, and his labored
breathing indicated the strain he was under. “From
a child I was imaginative, highly strung, nervous,”
he began. “As I grew older I gained self-control,
and when I entered Johns Hopkins University I was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>as normal as any student. I was very ambitious,
and during my last year overstudy and the tension
under which I was living brought on somnambulism.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Ethel, who was hanging on his words, was
unaware that she had spoken, but from that moment
she was Barclay’s only audience, and his voice deepened
with emotion as he rehearsed old memories and
lived through old scenes.</p>

<p>“I knew that as a boy I often talked in my sleep
when unduly excited by the day’s events,” he continued.
“But I was never aware that I ever walked
in my sleep, and Dr. Patterson, on discovering that
fact, never told me. One night he inadvertently
awoke me, and the revolver I had picked up from
his desk in the library, went off without my volition”&mdash;Barclay
shivered, lifted his manacled hands as if
to shut out a vision, and dropped them impotently.
“When fully awake I found Paul Patterson lying
dead across the desk, and the housekeeper crying:
‘Murder,’ as she ran through the house. My arrest
followed.”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to remember the case,” interrupted
Mitchell excitedly. “But the student’s name
was not Barclay&mdash;it was&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Julian Meredith,” answered Barclay. “Shortly
after my acquittal at the hands of the grand jury,
my mother’s cousin left me his fortune with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>proviso that I drop my last name and legally assume
his, which I did.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” Mitchell held up an imperative hand, and
Barclay paused. “Did not the proof of your somnambulistic
state rest on a letter written by Dr. Paul
Patterson and begun by him just before you shot
him, in which he mentioned your sleep-walking propensities,
and that you were at that moment walking
about in his library, sound asleep?”</p>

<p>“That is correct,” acknowledged Barclay.</p>

<p>“And this letter was secured by the housekeeper
who, instead of turning it over to the police, told its
contents to Dr. Patterson’s <i>fiancée</i> who, in revenge
for the killing of her lover, bribed the housekeeper
to withhold the letter,” added Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Which the housekeeper did,” said Barclay, “until
conscience made her confess to the police during my
third trial.”</p>

<p>“And the name of Dr. Paul Patterson’s <i>fiancée</i>
was&mdash;&mdash;” Mitchell paused, and Barclay filled in the
remainder of the sentence.</p>

<p>“Henrietta Patterson, a distant cousin.”</p>

<p>“And this Miss Henrietta Patterson was the only
sister of James Patterson,” finished Mitchell. “And
James Patterson died by your hand two nights
ago.”</p>

<p>“He did not,” declared Barclay vehemently. “As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>God is my witness, I never knowingly raised my hand
against any member of the Patterson family. You
can prove no motive for such a crime.”</p>

<p>“You’ve just supplied me with one,” returned
Mitchell. “Before I had only evidence of guilt to
go on, but now I’m positive of the motive. Henrietta
Patterson avenged her lover’s death by almost
sending you to the gallows, and you, in turn, avenged
the suffering she had caused you, by murdering her
brother.”</p>

<p>“A specious argument, nothing more,” scoffed
Barclay. “You have absolutely no proof against
me.”</p>

<p>Mitchell looked about him. “Suppose we sit
down,” he said, drawing up a chair. “Now we can
talk more comfortably. Mr. Barclay, why did you
carry a revolver the night of the fire?”</p>

<p>“I carried my revolver to use in case of encountering
the Jap, Ito, for whom I was searching.”</p>

<p>“Did you meet this Ito after securing your revolver?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Then at whom did you discharge your revolver?”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>“Did you discharge the revolver at James Patterson?”
persisted Mitchell, and this time Barclay’s
denial was prompt and forceful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“I did not,” he declared. “I did not discharge it
<i>at</i> anyone.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Barclay,” Mitchell slipped his hand inside
a pocket and produced a rag, and at sight of it Ethel
shivered. “Charles, the butler, swears that you used
this powder-stained flannel to clean your revolver
the morning after Patterson’s murder&mdash;and he was
killed by a thirty-two revolver bullet, such as you
use in your revolver.”</p>

<p>“I did not know that Patterson was killed by a
thirty-two caliber revolver bullet until after the inquest,”
retorted Barclay. “I thought, as did everyone
else, that he had been killed by the explosion
of Ogden’s rifle cartridges, and I cleaned that revolver
<i>before</i> the inquest.”</p>

<p>Mitchell shook his head. “That fact does not
help you,” he argued. “It only goes to show that
you knew before the others that Patterson was killed
by a thirty-two caliber bullet and that you cleaned
your revolver so that the bullet could not be said to
have been fired from your revolver. And you, with
your medical knowledge and past experience in a
murder trial, knew that the probing of the wound
would establish the fact that Patterson had been shot
by a thirty-two caliber bullet. You were simply forehanded
in cleaning your revolver.”</p>

<p>Before Mitchell had finished speaking Ethel was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>on her feet, her eyes flashing, and she turned and
addressed her companions, indignation in tone and
gesture.</p>

<p>“In his heckling of Mr. Barclay, the detective has
forgotten to inquire at whom Mr. Barclay fired,” she
said, and as Barclay looked up at her his haggard
face was transformed.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he exclaimed, springing to his feet. “As
I reached the back hall on my return from my fruitless
search for Ito, I made out dimly a figure advancing
head down, half crouching under the hall
light. Thinking it might be Ito overcome by the
smoke, I raised my revolver just as the fusillade of
shots rang out, and instinctively I pulled the trigger
of my revolver, supposing I was attacked.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you contend that you <i>accidentally</i> killed
James Patterson,” asked Mitchell incredulously. “It
strikes me that you are working the accident plea
rather fine.”</p>

<p>“I have not used it in this instance,” declared Barclay
hotly. “I did not shoot James Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Then the man advancing under the light was not
Patterson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was,” admitted Barclay. “But you will
all recall that Patterson was shot in the back;
whereas, when I fired that revolver I stood directly
in front of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Silence followed Barclay’s statement. Norcross
was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Did you observe anyone standing down the hall
behind Patterson?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, the dense smoke was drifting toward me,
and I could not see down the hall,” was Barclay’s
answer, and Norcross looked his disappointment.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly tell us, Mr. Barclay,” began
Mitchell, “if your bullet did not go into Mr. Patterson,
exactly where it did go.” He waited, and
then added significantly. “The walls and ceilings in
every direction on the second floor have been examined
by experts in search of thirty-two caliber bullets
which might have been imbedded in them; and
while we have found numerous thirty-eight caliber
bullets, none have been located in the neighborhood
where Mr. Patterson’s body was found. And every
bullet that has been found in other parts of the halls
and rooms has been a thirty-eight caliber bullet.
Where did your revolver bullet go?”</p>

<p>“Out of the hall window,” retorted Barclay. His
words caused a sensation. “Come upstairs and I
will show you,” he urged.</p>

<p>“Yes, come,” echoed Ethel, and taking Lois’ arm,
she led the way to the second floor back hall, Mitchell
marching stolidly by Barclay’s side, and the latter
had no opportunity to whisper a word of the gratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
overflowing his heart and soul to the girl who,
among them all, was the only one to champion his
cause.</p>

<p>On reaching the back hall Barclay moved down toward
the servants’ staircase. “I stood here,” he said.
“Norcross, just crouch down under the light and balance
yourself as if you were going to topple forward
on your face; yes, that’s about right, now, hold the
position&mdash;steady”&mdash;Barclay raised his right arm,
hand closed as if he grasped a revolver butt. “See,
the window at the curve of the hall is just in line&mdash;the
bullet passed directly through it.”</p>

<p>“Without breaking the glass?” asked Mitchell,
lifting his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“The window was open,” answered Barclay. “And
the current of air coming from there lifted the
smoke so that I could see a man’s figure crouching
where Norcross is&mdash;Thanks,” he added as Norcross
rose. “Now, I hope you are satisfied,
Mitchell?”</p>

<p>But Mitchell looked unconvinced. “It’s pretty
thin,” he grumbled. “You’ve got to produce that
bullet from somewhere in this neighborhood before
I’ll believe your bullet did not go into Patterson’s
body.”</p>

<p>“It’s a poor rule that doesn’t work both ways,”
exclaimed Ethel, who had loitered behind for a second.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
“If Mr. Barclay’s bullet entered Mr. Patterson’s
body, Mr. Mitchell, what became of the bullet
which struck this safe&mdash;see the mark&mdash;and ricocheted
from its bullet-proof surface. That bullet, if it did
not strike Mr. Patterson in the back, had to go somewhere&mdash;now,
where is it?”</p>

<p>The men stared at her in dumbfounded surprise,
then simultaneously they wheeled about and gazed
at the uninjured, unmarked wall paper down the hallway,
and when they turned back to Ethel, their faces
were as blank as the wall.</p>

<p>“Ethel, you’ve struck the nail on the head,”
shouted Ogden loudly. “Now, Mitchell, take off
those handcuffs and apologize to Mr. Barclay.”</p>

<p>Mitchell, with a bad grace, did the former but not
the latter. “I have two bullets to trace now, instead
of one,” he said. “But that does not exonerate
you, Mr. Barclay; and you will have to accompany
me to headquarters. I take it you will come peaceably?”
dangling the handcuffs suggestively before returning
them to his pocket.</p>

<p>“Certainly.” Barclay looked as if years had been
taken from him. “And my cousin, Mr. Walter Ogden,
will go surety for me, if you desire it.”</p>

<p>Ogden dropped the cigar he was lighting. “No,”
he said, his face red from the exertion of stooping.
“I am not a property owner in the district.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>“But I am,” put in Norcross. “I own this house,
Mitchell, and if anything is wanted, call on me.”</p>

<p>Barclay paused to wring the professor’s hand, and
when he turned back to the others Ethel and Lois
were nowhere in sight. “You must come with me at
once, Mr. Barclay,” insisted Mitchell at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Just a minute”&mdash;Barclay tore a leaf from his
memorandum book, and scribbled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>:</p>

<p>I must go at once to Detective Headquarters. I go with
a greater courage, a newer, happier faith in human nature,
inspired by you&mdash;the most loyal friend a man ever had. My
life&mdash;my love are yours. I pray God that soon I can stand
before you cleared of all suspicion, and ask the question
which honor forbids while I am under a cloud.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Julian.</span></p></div>

<p>Barclay folded the note and addressed it, then
catching up with Norcross and Ogden, and with
Mitchell at his heels, hastened into the lower hall.
Charles, much agitated, met them at the foot of the
staircase, and before he could speak, Barclay thrust
the note into his hand with a Treasury bill.</p>

<p>“Take this note at once to Miss Ethel,” he directed.</p>

<p>“Yes, sor,” promised Charles. “Mr. Ogden,
luncheon is served, sor.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank Heaven for small mercies!” ejaculated
Ogden. “Come on in, Norcross.”</p>

reached Walter Ogden’s ears, and making
a sign to Maru Takasaki commanding silence, he
tip-toed softly across the library and listened behind
the portières. It was some moments before Charles
appeared, struggling into his coat.</p>

<p>“Sure, be aisy,” Ogden heard him mutter, as the
bell pealed again. Reaching the front door the
butler pulled it open with some force, but the sight
of a tall well-dressed man standing in the vestibule
checked his inclination to be impertinent.</p>

<p>“No, sor, Misther Ogden is not home,” the butler’s
loud voice reached Ogden. “And Mrs. Ogden
is sick in bed; no, nothin’ serious, sor, just enough
to have Dr. McLane.”</p>

<p>“Can I see Miss Ethel Ogden?” and at the sound
of the visitor’s voice Ogden started violently.</p>

<p>“No, sor, Miss Ogden has retired for the night,”
answered Charles, and thinking to forestall further
questions, he added: “And Professor Norcross is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>dinin’ at the Cosmos Club, and Misther Barclay
ain’t returned since luncheon. Shall I tell them who
called, sor?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Carter Calhoun,” was the reply. “I will
call tomorrow. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sor,” Charles watched Calhoun go
down the steps and enter a taxicab, then closed the
door. “Sure, he’s an ilegant gintleman,” he said
aloud, garrulousness having grown upon him. “I’ll
remember him.”</p>

<p>“And so will I,” Ogden’s involuntary whisper
reached no ears but his own.</p>

<p>Ogden found his solitary guest sitting where he
had left him. Neither of the men spoke until Ogden
had resumed his old seat.</p>

<p>“That was Carter Calhoun,” announced Ogden,
but the name aroused no apparent interest in the expressionless
face and manner of his companion.
“He’s coming again.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“So,” Takasaki thought a minute, picked up a
small writing pad and using his gold pencil, jotted
down a number of figures, tore off the sheet and
handed it to his companion. Ogden’s eyebrows went
up as he read the numerals and the sign before them,
then crushing the scrap of paper in his hand, tossed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>it into the open fire on the hearth. Shifting his position
slightly, Takasaki contemplated Ogden at his
leisure by aid of the movable standing lamp, the only
electric light turned on in the room. The seconds
had become minutes before Takasaki spoke.</p>

<p>“Tonight is fair,” he said. “Tomorrow may be
stormy.”</p>

<p>Ogden stirred as if aroused from a hypnotic trance.
“Probabilities indicate a fair night,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Takasaki looked about the comfortable room,
then rose slowly to his feet. “I no keep you
longer,” he said, shaking hands. “You so good to
see me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you to the door,” and Ogden also
rose.</p>

<p>“It not necessary,” protested Takasaki politely.
“You have much to do&mdash;I know way out.”</p>

<p>But paying no heed to his protest Ogden accompanied
the Japanese attaché to the front door, and,
had Charles been loitering in the next room or the
floor above, he would not have guessed their presence.
They moved like shadows across the hall.</p>

<p>Ogden closed the door upon Takasaki with care
that it should not slam, then walking heavily over to
the pantry he called to Charles.</p>

<p>“Comin’, sor, comin’,” came the answer, and the
butler arrived in breathless haste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“Have Mr. Barclay and Professor Norcross returned?”</p>

<p>“No, sor,” Charles came a step nearer. “Mr. Barclay
telephoned an hour back, sor, to say he’d
be in about midnight, sor; but not to wait up for him,
because, sor, he still has the housekey Mrs. Ogden
gave him the night of the charity ball.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Ogden hesitated. “When Professor
Norcross returns tell him that I have gone to my
room.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sor.”</p>

<p>“Charles,” the butler stopped on his way downstairs.
“Close the house now, and after Professor
Norcross gets here, go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sor,” and Charles at once started
on his rounds of locking doors and windows, while
Ogden went straight to his wife’s bedroom. Ethel
met him at the door, a finger on her lip.</p>

<p>“Cousin Jane has just fallen asleep,” she whispered,
stepping into the hall and drawing to the
door. “Dr. McLane says it was only a nervous
breakdown, and that she will be all right tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow?” echoed Ogden. “Good. Go to
bed, child; you look as if you need a night’s rest,”
then he added as Ethel hesitated, “I’ll sit up with
Cousin Jane and be on hand if she requires anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>“Be sure and call me if I can be of assistance,”
Ethel took a step down the hall and then returned.
“Have you heard anything from Julian?”</p>

<p>“Charles said he telephoned that he would be
back about midnight,” answered Ogden impatiently.
“Probably the police put him through the third degree,
and found they hadn’t enough evidence to hold
him.”</p>

<p>Ethel’s fervidly whispered “Thank God!” was too
low to reach her cousin’s ears, and with a lighter
heart than she had known in many hours, she went
to her bedroom, but before starting to retire, she
read again and yet again Julian Barclay’s hastily
scrawled note brought to her by Charles before
luncheon.</p>

<p>For his size Walter Ogden was remarkably light
on his feet, and his restless pacing to and fro never
disturbed the sleeper on the bed. Many minutes
dragged themselves away before Ogden dropped
wearily into his wife’s favorite chair. But a veritable
demon of unrest drove him out of its comfortable
depths before he had been there ten minutes, and
he was passing the door when footsteps in the hall
reached him and he recognized Norcross’ voice
speaking to Charles. Before he could make up his
mind to go out and speak to the professor he heard
him close his bedroom door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>Crossing over to the hearth, on which burned a
small fire lighted by Ethel to take the chill off the
room, Ogden drew first one document out of his
pocket and then another, tossing them in succession
into the blaze. “I’ve got to do it,” he muttered between
clenched teeth, and the firelight showed the
dogged determination of his set, stern face. “Barclay,
well, Barclay’s got to”&mdash;he closed his outspread
hands slowly, forcefully, and turning about, again
sat down, this time nearer the fire and where his
gaze would not fall on his wife, still sleeping peacefully.
Sleep, however, was far from Ogden’s eyes
as he sat brooding over the fire. So great was his
absorption that he never heard Julian Barclay, his
footsteps lagging and weary, pass down the hall to
his bedroom.</p>

<p>Once in his bedroom Barclay threw his coat and
waistcoat on the nearest chair, kicked off his shoes,
and flinging himself on the bed drew up the outer
sheet and quilt, and was soon asleep, the heavy
dreamless sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>No sound broke the stillness except Barclay’s even
breathing, and the moonlight flooding his bedroom
fell softly across the bed where he slept. A movement
of the bedclothes caused a ripple in the moonlight,
then a shadow appeared, a shadow which
moved ever nearer Barclay’s head until a hand was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>outlined on the white pillow. The groping fingers,
with touch as delicate as a woman’s, at last found
the object they sought, but the soft sign of triumph
which came from the side of the high four-post bedstead
was premature.</p>

<p>Barclay felt the breaking of the cord which held
Ethel’s miniature suspended around his neck, and
throwing out his hands, his fingers closed on a human
wrist which tore and writhed in his grip. Struggling
to retain his hold and sit up at the same instant, Barclay
was horrified to hear Ethel’s voice raised in a
scream of terror.</p>

<p>“Help, Julian, for God’s sake, help!”</p>

<p>The hand was torn from his grasp as his fingers
relaxed their hold, and Barclay, forgetting all else,
rushed to Ethel’s aid. He stopped bewildered in
the hall; there was no sign of Ethel, and half crazed
at the thought of her in peril, he ran madly down
the staircase, her voice, fainter now, guiding his footsteps.
As he bounded down stairs he collided with
a man racing upward, and the contact brought them
both to the floor. Through the blinding stars produced
by his head coming in violent contact with the
sharp edge of the newel post, Barclay glimpsed
Yoshida Ito just staggering to his feet, and made a
futile grab at him. The agile Japanese avoided his
hand and fled upward, two steps at a time. Barclay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>was quick to follow, his fury lending wings to his
feet, and one idea obsessing him&mdash;the Japanese had
frightened, perhaps injured Ethel before he could
get there to save her.</p>

<p>As he ran upward Barclay became dimly conscious
that others were keeping step with him. Who
they were he never stopped to see; a stinging pain
in the back of his head and warm blood trickling
down his back dazed his senses. Another pajama-clad
figure appeared in one of the doorways as Barclay
sped down the second floor hall, and stared
aghast at him.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop, don’t stop,” Barclay panted.
“Hurry, Norcross, he’s just ahead of you; there,
jump for him.”</p>

<p>The Japanese, apparently confused by the chase,
had lost his bearings and cut back on his tracks, and
a second later he and Norcross went to the floor,
locked in each other’s arms. Barclay, struggling to
lend his aid to Norcross, bent over the fighting men,
but which was which was more than his failing sight
could distinguish. A strong hand pulled him back,
and Mitchell, with the aid of Dr. McLane, dragged
the men apart.</p>

<p>Barclay leaned weakly against the wall and stared
at the writhing Japanese, at the panting professor,
and last at Walter Ogden. His eyes were certainly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>deceiving him. With difficulty he checked an hysterical
laugh.</p>

<p>“Mitchell, you fool,” he gasped. “You’ve put
the handcuffs on the wrong man.”</p>

<p>Carter Calhoun, standing in the background, advanced
and laid his hand on Barclay’s swaying
shoulder.</p>

<p>“The handcuffs are where they belong, Barclay&mdash;on
the wrists of Richard Norcross, naturalist, murderer,
and ventriloquist.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ROAD TO HAPPINESS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>oo</span> thunderstruck to move or speak, the little
group in the hall stared at Norcross, down
whose white face great drops of perspiration were
stealing, then their regard was transferred to the
Japanese, Yoshida Ito, whose rough handling in the
fight with the professor was attested by the closing
of one eye and a bleeding lip. He looked far more
the criminal than the learned professor, and a cry
of protest broke from Ethel, who stood fully dressed
behind Leonard McLane.</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken,” she stammered, addressing
Colonel Calhoun. “Oh, say you have made some
mistake.”</p>

<p>“That would be to defeat the ends of justice,”
he said gravely. “Richard Norcross murdered
Dwight Tilghman and James Patterson.”</p>

<p>“You have no proof to substantiate your charge,”
retorted Norcross, speaking for the first time. “And
I deny it absolutely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” ironically, and Calhoun turned to
Ito. “I have a witness here who saw you drop Barclay’s
flask under the train at Atlanta, just after
Tilghman drank the poisoned brandy from it.
Speak up, Ito.”</p>

<p>The Japanese stepped forward into the center of
the group.</p>

<p>“It is true,” he began, without a trace of foreign
accent. “I picked up the flask immediately afterwards,
and had its contents tested on reaching Washington.”</p>

<p>Norcross faced them undauntedly. “Will you
gentlemen, Americans all, take the word of a renegade
Japanese, a lying treacherous murderer, against
me, an American in good repute, a naturalist of some
renown?” Silence answered him, and he continued
more rapidly. “I was with Dr. Horace Shively during
the whole time the train was in Atlanta&mdash;if
you accuse me of the crime&mdash;you must accuse him
also.”</p>

<p>“You were talking to Shively the whole time you
were standing on the vestibule of the smoker, while
he sat on the lower step with his back to you,” corrected
Calhoun. “And while giving him a description
of a South American trip, you, using your
powers of ventriloquism to carry on your tale unbroken,
which made him think you were still standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
right behind him, slipped inside the open door
of the smoker&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait,” interrupted Ito, seeing that Norcross was
about to speak. “Tilghman was sitting right at the
end of the car, but a step or two inside the open
door.”</p>

<p>“And Tilghman obligingly permitted me to drop
the oxalic acid inside the small mouthpiece of the
flask,” broke in Norcross scornfully.</p>

<p>“No. You crept up behind him and dropped the
powder into the wide silver cup of the flask, which
Tilghman held in his hand, and out of which he was
intermittently sipping brandy while sitting with his
eyes closed.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? And why was I not seen doing all this
by the people in the car on the next track?”</p>

<p>“Because the window shade was down,” was Ito’s
prompt reply. “It was in the cup that the chemist
found the dregs containing oxalic acid.”</p>

<p>“So!” Norcross smiled bitterly. “You have
learned your lesson well from your master, Carter
Calhoun,” and there was no mistaking the fury which
blazed in the professor’s eyes as he turned on his
chief accuser. “Your fantastic statement that I am
a ventriloquist is without foundation and is a lie.”</p>

<p>For answer Calhoun took a worn magazine cutting
from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>“Your past condemns you,” he said sternly. “Our
brain plays us queer tricks at times. In talking of
your South American trip to Dr. Shively while in the
act of poisoning Dwight Tilghman you gave the clew
to his murder. I have a retentive memory, and the
mention of your South American trip recalled a
magazine article, published many years ago, recounting
your adventures in the wildest part of the
Amazon&mdash;and in that article you made mention of
your mimicry of the human voice and of bird calls,
and spoke of once extricating yourself from a dangerous
situation among a hostile tribe by the use of
ventriloquism, of which you said you were a past
master.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” But Norcross’ lips were trembling. “All
manufactured out of whole cloth.”</p>

<p>“No,” Calhoun handed the clipping to Mitchell.
“After talking with Dr. Shively this morning I went
to the Congressional Library, and there found the
magazine on file, and was permitted to take this
clipping from one of the copies. Out of your own
mouth, Norcross, you are condemned.”</p>

<p>Leonard McLane stepped forward. “If additional
evidence is needed,” he said. “I can testify
that Ethel Ogden and I were attending Mrs. Ogden
in her bedroom when we apparently heard Ethel’s
voice from the hall crying: ‘Help, Julian, for God’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>sake, help!’ We heard the voice continue down the
hall, and all the while Ethel stood facing me, absolutely
silent.”</p>

<p>Ethel, who had kept in the background, advanced
to Barclay’s side. She avoided looking at Norcross.
“Did you, Julian, the night you chased this Japanese,”
indicating Ito, “out into the back yard, say to
him, ‘Ito, I tell you I have no more money to spare’?”</p>

<p>Barclay looked at her in blank amazement. “No,
I never made such a remark,” he protested. “I
did not catch up with Ito.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” confirmed the Japanese. “I have
never exchanged a word with Mr. Barclay since our
meeting in the train.”</p>

<p>Ethel looked accusingly at Norcross. “You were
at my side&mdash;by using ventriloquism you made me
think that Julian Barclay was in collusion with Ito,
then accused of the murder of Dwight Tilghman.”</p>

<p>The professor’s eyes fell before her passionate indignation,
and when he looked up he addressed
Colonel Calhoun exclusively.</p>

<p>“I did all that you accuse me of,” he said coldly,
and his hearers gathered closer about him. “The
Japanese are good paymasters.” He looked at Walter
Ogden. “You have found them so&mdash;” with insolent
meaning.</p>

<p>“No.” Ogden drew himself erect. “Although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>Takasaki tried to bribe me earlier tonight to engineer
a Congressional lobby to prevent passage of the bills
for universal military service. Most of my fortune
is invested in Eastern trade, and has been practically
swept away by the ruining of our Pacific shipping.
The Japanese are aware of my financial straits, and
brought pressure to bear to make me accept their
offer.” Ogden cleared his throat. “I had but one
alternative&mdash;to apply to my wife’s cousin and our
guest, Julian Barclay, to loan me ready money to
tide me over the next few months. My wife had a
heart attack a little after one o’clock this morning
and I telephoned for Dr. McLane. My wife’s condition&mdash;”
he gulped and broke down.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to assist you financially,”
volunteered Barclay; then addressing Norcross,
“What was your object in poisoning Dwight Tilghman?
You appeared the best of friends on the
train.”</p>

<p>“I killed him because he had stolen important
documents from a Japanese Secret Service agent, Mr.
Soto, in San Francisco”&mdash;a low cry of astonishment
broke from Ethel. “I had to recover the documents
before Tilghman returned them to the Secretary of
War,” added Norcross sullenly.</p>

<p>“But I was too quick for you,” put in Ito. “A
cipher dispatch from Colonel Calhoun told me of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>Tilghman’s mission east and of the rumor that the
Japanese were trailing him. I boarded the train the
morning of Tilghman’s murder, and tried to speak
to him, but he at first took me for an enemy. I approached
him in the smoker, and during our scuffle
slipped a note in his hand.”</p>

<p>“I saw you do it,” exclaimed Barclay.</p>

<p>Ito nodded. “Tilghman, taken by surprise, was
somewhat clumsy. He evidently regarded the warning
from Calhoun as genuine, but not willing to trust
a Japanese wholly, he slipped the documents into your
pocket, Mr. Barclay, for safe keeping, when borrowing
your flask....”</p>

<p>“My pocket?” Barclay stared at Ito blankly. “I
found no documents&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But only a miniature,” supplemented Ito. “The
documents are concealed behind Miss Ogden’s miniature,
which was painted without her knowledge by
a Japanese artist, Soto, a member of their Secret
Service on duty in Washington until recently, who
admired Miss Ogden extravagantly, but who did
not hesitate to use her beauty to shield his efforts to
smuggle documents out of the United States.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you secured your information,”
said Norcross scowling at Ito; “but it is correct.
The United States Secret Service got wind of
our activities, and it was next to impossible to pass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>written data out of the country; therefore Soto, who
spent the past year posing as a guest at the Japanese
Embassy, conceived the idea of secreting the documents
inside the gold miniature case which held the
portrait of Miss Ogden, painted surreptitiously by
him. When the miniature was stolen from Soto by
Tilghman I was engaged to get it back. I had traveled
before with Tilghman, and we were the best
of friends&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you were aware of his having no sense of
taste,” suggested McLane.</p>

<p>“I was; and I used oxalic acid because its symptoms
are similar to those produced by heart disease,”
explained Norcross, no touch of feeling in his
voice. “Thinking Tilghman’s death would be attributed
to heart failure, I removed the flask&mdash;for
if it had been found, it might have been tested and
suspicion aroused of foul play. Frankly, if I had
realized that Tilghman’s death would be instantly
investigated by Dr. Shively, I would have left Barclay’s
flask to incriminate him. Instead, I flung it
under the car, thinking the train would crush it beyond
recognition when we moved out of Atlanta.”</p>

<p>Ethel shuddered at the cold-blooded confession,
and they all stared at Norcross, whose defiant manner
repelled the faintest spark of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a cool one!” Detective Mitchell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>looked at his prisoner in amazement. “Was it just
the desire to kill, or had you some grudge against
James Patterson which made you murder him?”</p>

<p>Norcross glared at his questioner. “It was not
murder,” he protested, “but chance. I overheard
Miss Ogden ask James Patterson to get her miniature
out of the burning room.”</p>

<p>“Did you know I had your miniature?” gasped
Ethel.</p>

<p>“No, but not finding it among Tilghman’s effects,
which I searched under Dr. Shively’s intelligent supervision,”
with an evil smile, “I was desperate, and
any miniature of you interested me. I decided to
take a look at this miniature; bolted up the staircase,
and accidently ran against Patterson, knocking a
photograph out of his hand. We both stooped for
it and managed between us to tear it, the upper half
remaining in my grasp,” he stopped and bowed to
Ethel, mockingly, “I sent it to you,” then continued
to the others. “Patterson cursed me and ran on,
first into Ogden’s bedroom and then into the burning
room.”</p>

<p>“So he beat you to it,” commented Mitchell.</p>

<p>Norcross shrugged his shoulders. “What need
for me to enter the burning room when Patterson
would obligingly rescue what I wanted? I waited in
Ogden’s bedroom, but being half-blinded by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>smoke, Patterson slipped by me unseen, and my intention
of jerking the miniature out of his hand and
disappearing was frustrated. Since Tilghman’s
death I have always gone armed for any emergency,
and catching a glimpse of Patterson as he raced out
of the door, I fired my revolver at him.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” ejaculated Mitchell turning to look at the
safe before which they were standing.</p>

<p>“I missed, the blinding smoke spoiling my aim,”
finished Norcross. “As you know, the bullet struck
the safe, ricocheted down the hall and hit Patterson
in a vital spot. When I reached the hall I made out
Patterson lying on the floor and another man stooping
over him, a man who helped himself to the
miniature and the torn photograph which Patterson
dropped in his fall.” Norcross’ eyes traveled suggestively
toward Barclay.</p>

<p>“Yes, I took them,” admitted Barclay.</p>

<p>“Curse you for a meddlesome fool!” exclaimed
Norcross, and his eyes were venomous. “I knew
your history, and did everything to manufacture evidence
against you; but you crossed me at every turn.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you speak of this sooner, Julian?”
asked Ogden, breaking his long silence.</p>

<p>“Because I believed until after the inquest that
James Patterson had been accidently killed by the
discharge of one of Ogden’s cartridges,” answered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>Barclay. “That I took from him a miniature which
I considered mine, and a torn half of my own photograph,
I believed no one’s business but mine, and
held my tongue about them. It never dawned on me
that Patterson was killed on account of the miniature,”
he paused and added wearily, “I wanted to
help in investigating Tilghman’s death, but handicapped
by my past, I dared not do so openly. You
see, I had lost money heavily to Tilghman the night
before the murder; I had loaned him my flask, and
the poison had been administered in brandy; and I
had no alibi&mdash;these, I knew, would prove damning
facts against a man who had already been tried for
murder.”</p>

<p>“And acquitted,” added Ethel. Barclay brightened
at sound of her clear confident voice.</p>

<p>“I did go to see Dr. McLane,” he went on, “to
tell him what little I knew of Tilghman’s death and
my suspicions, and McLane&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Recognized you almost at once,” said the surgeon
quietly. “There were not so many honor men
in the senior class at Johns Hopkins University that
I should not have recollected you, Barclay, even if
I was only a freshman when you were there. And
your trial absorbed my attention. Also,” he spoke
with growing earnestness, “I have always regretted
that you did not pursue your profession, for which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>as a student, you showed so brilliant an aptitude.”</p>

<p>“I owe you a great deal, McLane,” Barclay’s tone
was husky. “Some day, perhaps&mdash;” he broke off
abruptly.</p>

<p>Norcross smiled scornfully. “People do not desire
a physician with sleep-walking propensities,” he
sneered brutally. “I am hardly surprised you became
a wanderer in other lands. And you”&mdash;swinging on
the Japanese&mdash;“for you there will be no land of
refuge&mdash;the Japanese never pardon a traitor.”</p>

<p>The man addressed laughed softly. “My Japanese
is but skin deep and removable,” he said, rubbing
off some of his make-up. “My somewhat Oriental
cast of features enabled me to take this disguise
on numerous occasions, as the United States
Secret Service, to which I belong, believes in fighting
the devil with fire.”</p>

<p>Barclay listened to him with eyes almost starting
from his head. “You fooled me completely,” he
stammered. “Why did you draw the design of my
flask on the table cloth in the dining car?”</p>

<p>“Because I desired to test you and find out if you
had a guilty knowledge of Tilghman’s death,” was
the answer. “I had seen you loan him your flask
at the time he slipped the miniature in your pocket.
I was also behind you when you started from the
station and saw you bolt back to the train at sight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>of James Patterson, but believing Tilghman was
watchful and would be on guard, I went to the public
library, and thus gave you, Professor, a chance
to poison him,” and the Secret Service operative
glared at Norcross.</p>

<p>“In avoiding James Patterson I acted on impulse,”
explained Barclay, breaking the pause. “I had not
seen him for years. I have never outgrown the
horror of having accidentally killed Paul Patterson,
and the sight of his cousin brought back the whole
tragedy, and not feeling like meeting people, I went
back to my car,” he stopped and again addressed the
man called Ito. “I saw a flask I mistook for mine
on the desk in the library at the Japanese Embassy
the night of the reception.”</p>

<p>“I watched you take the flask, and realized that
you had made a mistake,” said the Secret Service
operative. “I was detailed with several plain clothes
policemen to watch the cloaks and wraps, as is frequently
done at large semi-public receptions, and
went in my Japanese disguise. When you saw me, I
disappeared into the library, and on your entrance
slipped into the conservatory and watched you from
there.”</p>

<p>“Why in the world didn’t you come and ask me
for the miniature, if you knew I had it?” demanded
Barclay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“Because I was aware that Norcross, whom I
strongly suspected, did not know you had the miniature.
By bribing Charles, the butler, I had the run
of the house, and on the night of your dinner, Ogden,
I was busy searching Norcross’ bedroom for incriminating
papers when I detected smoke and rushed
downstairs to warn you and your guests that the
house was on fire.”</p>

<p>“But why did you close and lock the drawing room
doors after shouting ‘Fire’?” asked McLane, before
Ogden could speak.</p>

<p>“I slammed the doors shut to avoid meeting Barclay
and being arrested on the charge of murdering
Tilghman,” retorted Ito dryly. “I did not know
there was a snap lock on the drawing room doors
until afterward. The fire had gained headway, as I
stopped to turn in a fire alarm before warning you;
and not wishing to be known then under my rightful
name of Jack Gilmore, United States Secret Service
operative, I disappeared. Investigation has proved
that the fire started from defective electric wires,
and was not connived by you, Norcross”&mdash;Gilmore,
alias Ito, faced the professor directly. “I was
morally certain that you had murdered Tilghman,
but had not real proof against you, as you were apparently
with Shively while the train was at Atlanta;
so I decided to use the miniature as a decoy to trap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>you into a confession of guilt. But that even would
have failed had not Colonel Calhoun proved you an
accomplished ventriloquist.”</p>

<p>Barclay felt his throat tenderly. “Norcross stole
the miniature from me just now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And I have it.” The Secret Service operative
laid the miniature in Calhoun’s hand.</p>

<p>“Well done, Gilmore,” he exclaimed, examining
the miniature. “I am sorry to break so beautiful a
painting of you, Miss Ogden&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, please do,” begged Ethel. “It is too associated
with murder and treachery for me ever to
want to look at it again.”</p>

<p>There was a faint tinkle of broken glass and ivory
as Calhoun ground his heel into the miniature, and
gathering up the gold frame and its broken contents,
he withdrew from behind the ivory many sheets of
folded rice paper on which were fine writing and
cabalistic signs.</p>

<p>“The Secretary of War will sleep easier in his
bed than he has for many nights,” he said. “God!”
He swung on Norcross, one hand lifted menacingly.
“Murder I can understand, but treachery and treason&mdash;you!”&mdash;in
gathering fury&mdash;“What shall I call
you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The nameless man,” was the bitter retort. “Why
should I show loyalty to a country whose people repudiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
my mother because she married a ‘yellow’
man.”</p>

<p>“Your father, then&mdash;” Calhoun stepped back, astounded.</p>

<p>“Was a Japanese, yes. And I was educated partly
in this country and partly in Japan. I inherited my
mother’s white skin and facial characteristics, <i>only</i>,”
with emphasis. “While in Japan I assume my father’s
name; while I am an American naturalist, I use
my mother’s maiden name.”</p>

<p>Calhoun looked at him for a long moment in silence.
“A hybrid! You and your kind are the future
problem of the United States,” he said solemnly.
“Take your prisoner, Mitchell.”</p>

<p>With ashen face the man they had known as Richard
Norcross stepped between them as they lined up
against the wall, and ignoring their presence, he
walked steadily down the staircase, Mitchell by his
side, and into the waiting police automobile.</p>

<p>As the footsteps of the departing men echoed
through the silent house, Barclay moved gropingly
toward Ethel; then the false strength, which had
fought off physical weakness, deserted him, and without
word or sound he went crashing to the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five hours later Barclay opened his eyes, and at
first too dazed to move, lay in bed gazing in bewilderment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
at Leonard McLane taking a quiet
snooze in a near-by chair. Gradually Barclay pieced
together the events of the night which culminated
in the arrest of the murderer and the solution of the
mysteries surrounding the death of Dwight Tilghman
and James Patterson. A light footstep and the
swish of a skirt caused him to turn as quickly as his
bandaged head permitted, but the sight of Ethel
Ogden repaid him for the excruciating pain that followed
the movement.</p>

<p>“How is Julian, Doctor?” asked Ethel. Her low
voice brought McLane to his feet and he smiled
sleepily at her.</p>

<p>“You caught me napping,” he admitted. “How
did you leave Mrs. Ogden?”</p>

<p>“Very much better; the trained nurse says she has
rallied wonderfully,” Ethel tip-toed into the room.
“It was so fortunate that Cousin Walter got you
immediately on the telephone, on discovering Cousin
Jane’s condition.”</p>

<p>“I was sitting up talking to Mitchell and Carter
Calhoun,” explained McLane, “We were threshing
out the problems of the two tragedies. Calhoun,
who called here earlier in the evening, was longing
to see you and ask about the miniature, as well as
talk with Norcross, with whom he has had a more
or less scientific correspondence for a number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>years, and he suggested that I bring him and Mitchell
with me. He argued that you would undoubtedly
be up if your cousin was ill. They were waiting
downstairs talking to Gilmore, alias Ito, when Julian
Barclay made his spectacular run downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” Ethel shaded her eyes. “He must have
hurt himself seriously when he struck his head
against the newel post.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Ethel, men have tough skulls,” smiled
McLane. “Barclay lost a great deal of blood while
we stood talking in the hall, and that is mainly responsible
for his loss of consciousness. I assure you
he is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quite recovered,” said Barclay, and at the sound
of his weak voice McLane hastened to the bed, leaving
Ethel to follow more slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t pronounce you quite recovered,” he
said, feeling Barclay’s pulse and examining the bandages.
“But you are getting along satisfactorily.
Come and see for yourself, Ethel,” making room
for her, but she approached only as far as the foot
of the bed. McLane, his eyes twinkling, was about
to speak again when a tap sounded at the side of
the open door, and Charles looked in.</p>

<p>“If ye please, sor, Misther Ogden do be axin’ for
ye, Doctor,” he announced. “And he’s in the divil
of a hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>McLane smiled. “I’ll come at once,” he paused
at the door, and Ethel, walking at his heels, stopped
herself just in time from bumping into him. “Please
wait, Ethel, and find out if Barclay needs any beef
tea or coffee,” he said, and slipped away; the quick-witted
Irish servant hastening after him, conveniently
blind to Ethel’s beckoning finger.</p>

<p>Slowly, shyly Ethel approached the bed. “Would
you care for some bouillon?” she asked. Barclay
watched her with passionate, longing eyes.</p>

<p>“What did you say?” He raised his bandaged
head. “I can’t possibly hear you at that distance,”
he protested, and her heart beating with maddening
rapidity, Ethel drew nearer, step by step, until she
reached his side.</p>

<p>“Would you like something?” she asked faintly,
not meeting his eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;you.” Barclay looked at her pleadingly,
his voice deserting him. He reached up and imprisoned
her hand, and as her fingers nestled in his
broad palm a ring fell out of her grasp. “My
ring?” he said, catching it up in his other hand.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was bringing it back to you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ethel!” Barclay’s face grew ghastly, as hope
and happiness died away.</p>

<p>“Only to ask you to explain this sketch.” Ethel
was stammering badly as she held her mother’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>drawing before Barclay’s eyes. “Mother saw your
hand, or what we thought your hand, wearing that
ring, through the Pullman car window at the Atlanta
station just at the time Dwight Tilghman was
poisoned&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barclay looked at the sketch with dawning comprehension.
“Will you hand me my tobacco pouch
and the small book by it,” indicating a table by the
bed. Ethel quickly laid the two articles in his outstretched
hand, and tearing out a cigarette paper,
Barclay held it in exactly the position indicated in
the sketch. “It might very well be mistaken for a
paper containing a powder,” he said. “When traveling
about I make my own cigarettes, but in cities I
buy them already made. I recall now starting to
smoke on my return to the Pullman, but awoke from
my preoccupation to realize that I must not smoke
in that car, so I tipped up the paper at that angle
to pour the tobacco back into my pouch just at the
moment your mother saw me.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t see you, only your hand,” explained
Ethel. “And it seemed so mysterious&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You told no one&mdash;” Ethel shook her head, and
the look that leaped into Barclay’s eyes repaid her.
“I owe you everything,” he said, his voice shaking
with emotion. “If Mitchell had heard of your
mother’s sketch, I might have had great difficulty in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>convincing him of my innocence.” Barclay shivered.
“All this has brought back so vividly the death of
Paul Patterson&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush! you must not think of it,” and Ethel laid
a tender hand on his eyes. He drew it down and
kissed it lingeringly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will teach me to forget,” he said
wistfully. “Paul Patterson was a splendid fellow,
working his way along and building up a fine practice.
He would not marry Henrietta Patterson until
he could support her in comfort, having a horror of
being thought a fortune hunter. They had planned
a spring wedding&mdash;and six weeks before it Fate and
I stepped in”&mdash;Barclay closed his eyes. “I had one
interview with Henrietta Patterson, and it will live
in my memory always.”</p>

<p>“These are morbid fancies,” protested Ethel
warmly. “You are not fair to yourself, Julian. You
are too young a man to have your whole life blasted
by an accident, no matter how tragic, which was the
direct result of overstudy and ill-health. Will you
promise me to think only of the future?”</p>

<p>“I will do anything&mdash;everything for you,” exclaimed
Barclay passionately; then, with desperate
courage, “My darling, I have so little to offer you
except my love that it seems utter presumption on
my part to entreat you to marry me. Answer me,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>Ethel, here and now,” and seizing her hand he
looked up into her eyes.</p>

<p>The carmine deepened in Ethel’s pale cheeks, but
her gaze did not falter, and stooping nearer as she
read those half imperious but imploring eyes, her
smiling lips met his. With a low cry of unutterable
joy, Barclay’s arms closed around her, and his voice,
clear and tender, murmured: “My loyal sweetheart!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
